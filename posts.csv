2105,A Digital Advertiser’s Holiday Checklist,"<strong>Tips on Maximizing the Effectiveness of Digital Holiday Ads<img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-2107"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eGood-Cheer-151x300.png"" alt=""eGood Cheer"" width=""151"" height=""300"" /></strong>

Just like Santa has a holiday checklist, Goodway Group does too. The programmatic ad tech firm is delivering a handy checklist of what brands need to consider when deploying digital ads during the holiday season.

“Digital experiences represent 48 percent of the total time consumers spend with media. So it is imperative to develop a plan that focuses on how and where consumers are absorbing information,” says Jay Friedman, chief operating officer of the Goodway Group. “It’s important to capitalize on these consumer wants and needs, especially during the holiday season, to ring up the jingle.”

With that in mind, Goodway Group offers five key checklist items for digital advertising:
<ol>
 	<li>Specialized keywords in pay-per-click (PPC). Holiday shoppers are now searching for items and categories that they don’t normally search for during the rest of the year. Relying only on data from previous months to create a plan simply won’t take into account the unique searches that happen this time of year.</li>
 	<li>Place a heavy focus on mobile. Larger retailers should place a heavy focus on mobile, as it is on par with desktop for reaching a desired target market segment. Have consideration for those who search their smartphone while in the very act of shopping!</li>
 	<li>Give enough lead time. Use specialized keywords in PPC for search traffic, and get advertising started with enough lead time in order maximize its potential. How much lead time? At least a week.</li>
 	<li>Start media now. Advertisers are sorely mistaken when they think that turning advertising on means more sales and turning it off means less sales. There is at least one week of lag time in behavioral effect from advertising.</li>
 	<li>Publishers should limit excessive use of ads. Publishers should not overload their site with too many ads or nonrelevant messaging. It will give short-term gain but hurts in the long run, because frustrated site visitors may turn to ad-blockers for relief.</li>

The 2015 digital marketing industry was dominated by native advertising, an increase in programmatic ad spending, hyper-segmentation and viewability. But as 2015 comes to a close, marketers are beginning to observe what digital marketing trends are going to arise in 2016.

Jay Friedman, chief operating officer of the programmatic ad tech firm Goodway Group, offers his predictions on what 2016 digital marketing trends are going to take hold and impact the industry:

• <strong>People-based Marketing</strong> – 2016 will be the first year people-based marketing (rather than device-based or cookie-based for behaviors) really takes off. Facebook will launch their DSP and be the only player truly offering this. This is a major game changer as advertisers will have a whole new understanding of the subject matter their audience will respond to in advertisements.

• <strong>Ad Blocking Leveling Out</strong> – Smart publishers will take control and start earning a fair price for their inventory. They’ll disallow <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/digital-state-union-rising-threat-ad-blockers/"">ad blocking</a>, and some will start to make 100 percent of their ad slots 100 percent viewable with infinite scroll ads. Publishers and consumers will be forced to find a happy medium between excessive ads and ad blockers so both parties benefit in the end.

• <strong>Programmatic Specific Agencies</strong> – At least five major brands will select programmatic-specific agencies apart from their existing formal agency relationships in order to capitalize on advertisements. Conversely, many large regional or smaller national brands will still not be using their first-party data as of the first of the year.

• <strong>ROI</strong> – Market leaders will enable clear offline <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/optimize-campaign-roi-without-touching-media/"">ROI tracking</a> from online spend. This will allow them to analyze their process and content in order to make their digital campaigns even more effective while getting the best bang for their buck.

• <strong>ROI dislodges ‘clutter metrics’</strong>– Those who are hyper-focused on viewability, fraud, ad blocking and all the other clutter will realize, it is all important, but it’s less important than measuring actual sales impact. While it’s important to pay attention to those clutter metrics, they should guide, not direct, as ROI is the ultimate stop.

For the first time, digital ad spending will surpass traditional television ad spending in the U.S. in 2016, indicating the ever-growing power of the digital marketing industry. Consequently, marketers are already preparing for next year to ensure advertising plans are effective and achieve top-notch results.

2328,Goodway Group Explains Cross-Device Targeting,"<strong>2016 Set to Usher in New Way of Reaching Consumers and Explaining Behavior</strong>

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/crossdevice/"" rel=""attachment wp-att-2337""><img class=""alignright wp-image-2337"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/CrossDevice-300x275.png"" alt=""CrossDevice"" width=""425"" height=""389"" /></a>These days, consumers of media content split their time between all sorts of devices including mobile phones, tablets and desktops, expanding the avenues of target marketing beyond just websites. Targeting users across all of these platforms, called cross-device targeting, allows for precise marketing where individual users spend the most of their time, thereby optimizing campaigns to reach the highest conversion rates.

Goodway Group, the U.S.’s leading programmatic media services partner and an industry leader in cross-device targeting, provides need-to-know information on cross-device targeting and why marketers should be implementing it sooner rather than later.

The two most important aspects of cross-device targeting that marketers need to know are defined as:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Audience Targeting</strong>: Audience targeting allows advertisers to extend reach and control frequency on all of a users’ devices in any combination. It goes beyond PCs, tablets, phones – reaching users on connected TVs, gaming consoles and across the different mobile browsers and apps. Advertisers can even re-target users that might lead to an impression based on their particular data or by utilizing third-party behavioral data to target new users based on their previous online activity.</li>
 	<li><strong>Attribution Reporting:</strong> Advertisers can obtain deep insights into users’ conversion behavior by specific device with cross-device attribution reporting. This allows publishers to capture secured conversions, even after the initial ad impression takes place. For example, a user sees an ad on their mobile device, then makes the actual purchase of the advertised product or service at a later time using their desktop computer.</li>
</ol>
Here’s specifically how cross-device targeting works:
<ol>
 	<li>Companies that specialize in building cross-device graphs continually gather individual consumer data from users’ IP addresses, cookies, time of day visitation, app usage, regular site visits and device IDs.</li>
 	<li>This gathered data is then fed through an algorithm, which creates the cross-device graph so that marketers can understand specific device usage as it relates to individual users. As a result, marketers obtain the insight and ability to create customized campaigns with optimal targeting techniques, earning a higher rate of conversion success.</li>
</ol>
“With cross-device technology, marketers no longer miss a specific target audience or their activities on particular marketing channels,” says Jay Friedman, chief operating officer of Goodway Group. “The cross-device methodology allows marketers to cover all their targeting bases, while attributing both behavioral impressions and conversions.”

In any market economy, who wins out shifts with economic ups and downs. The digital advertising market is no exception. And today, sellers—that is, publishers—are winning, especially as we’re learning there’s a finite source of quality, viewable inventory available in the open exchange. Now publishers have a great opportunity to re-engineer their inventory to exploit the massive demand out there for quality placements. But how?

2368,Goodway Group Develops Algorithm to Manage Ad Frequency,"<strong>Value-added Service Designed to Maximize Targeting of Consumers</strong>

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goodway Group</a><a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""alignright wp-image-2372"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/iStock_000000577048_Large-300x159.jpg"" alt=""Frequency"" width=""425"" height=""226"" /></a>, the U.S.’s leading managed-services programmatic partner to local, regional, and Fortune 500 brand agencies, has developed a value-added proprietary service for their clients to help maximize mismanaged frequency targeting in digital ad campaigns–an issue currently causing marketers to waste approximately four percent of their total spends.

When targeting users through typical digital campaigns, marketers can set a daily limit of ads they can serve throughout the day or set a campaign cap of how many ads they can serve over the course of a campaign. However, when marketers use this “set it and forget it” model of serving ads, they’re missing out on a portion of prime impressions and possible conversions–because many who are repeatedly served have no purchase intention.

These ads are being repeatedly served to users who have either already been exposed enough times to indicate they won’t take action, or they simply have no intention of taking action to begin with. Yet many marketers continue to serve these non-buyers the same ads because of the “set it and forget it” model, leading to wasteful spending by marketers who aren’t achieving the highest possible conversion rates.

In studying this issue, Goodway created an innovative proprietary algorithm solution.

The algorithm went through 30 days of development and an additional 30 days of testing to ensure its success in optimizing target audiences. The algorithm is capable of deciding when it’s no longer worth showing the same user another ad impression and when it’s instead advantageous to show a different user with less frequency an additional impression.

“Four percent of a digital budget may not sound like a lot,” says Jay Friedman, chief operating officer of Goodway Group. “However, in this day and age, a typical digital ad campaign has a $10 million budget. So $400,000 then becomes a large chunk of the budget that could be used much more effectively.”

Goodway Group uses this value-added service to ensure their clients receive the highest conversion rates possible on their digital ad campaigns.

<h4><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHAT IS A DMP?</span></h4>
A Data Management Platform (DMP) is a technology that aggregates, houses, sorts, analyzes, and finds connections between massive amounts of online, offline, first-party, second-party, and third-party data fed to it.
<h4><span style=""color: #000000;"">WHY USE A DMP?</span></h4>
A DMP makes data accessible and actionable. It can create fuller customer profiles by centralizing data sets that otherwise would be siloed. Then by linking into a DSP, the knowledge from the connected data in the DMP can be activated.

This can boost advertising ROI by more accurately targeting the right person with the right message.
<h4><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>HOW IS A DMP USED IN PROGRAMMATIC?</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Segments customer attributes for more accurate targeting</li>
 	<li>Builds look-alike segments for prospecting new customers</li>
 	<li>Expands campaign reach by linking first-party data to second- and third-party data</li>
 	<li>Delivers hypertargeted messaging to each segment</li>
 	<li>Unlocks purchase-behavior insights</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong>HOW A DMP WORKS</strong></span></h4>
<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Data Collection
</span></strong>Data is imported from as many customer data streams as a company has available. Then the DMP organizes each piece of user data and puts it into categories to build individual user profiles.

<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Data Management
</span></strong>Once the data is imported and sorted, it can provide great insights about how to segment audiences and determine what targeted messages they should receive. Ad buyers can tell the DMP who they are trying to find by asking it to reach audiences with certain attributes based on the user profiles from step one above, the data-collection phase.

<strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Data Activation
</span></strong>The DMP is synced up to a DSP. Then the DMP sends real-time instructions about what ads to buy. If ad space is bought, it will decide what message should be served, based on the user profile.

<span style=""color: #000000;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Optimization</span>
</strong></span>After an ad is bought and served, the result is measured. Those results become more data the DMP will learn from and store. The instructions the DMP is feeding the DSP can be optimized. And the process starts again.

2428,Connecting Offline Data for Online Success,"<em>Contributed by <strong>Amanda Martin, Director, Account Strategy, Northeast Region at Goodway Group</strong></em>

<img class=""alignright wp-image-2435"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/iStock_000009077543_Large-300x223.jpg"" alt=""iStock_000009077543_Large"" width=""374"" height=""278"" />Connecting offline data to online, which historically has been siloed from online marketing initiatives, can be the key to improving targeting and campaign measurement.

Offline data is data collected and stored in “offline” systems, for example, CRM platforms, point-of-sale (POS) systems, email-marketing platforms, and contact-center applications. Ideally, it is tied to some form of personally identifiable information (PII) including but not limited to email address, name, postal address, or customer ID. Offline data can include first-party information, which is considered the most valuable, but also can include third-party information like demographics and buyer propensities.

The act of connecting offline data to online is called “data onboarding” or more recently “connectivity.” The most important principle to this process is privacy; by de-identifying PII in both offline and online data sets, data vendors can connect the dots but also protect the individual’s privacy and the brand’s integrity.
<h3><span style=""color: #000000;"">Offline Data Tactics</span></h3>
Data onboarding allows marketers to increase targeting efficiency and close the gaps within campaign measurement. Below are the key offline data tactics in practice today:
<h4><span style=""color: #0000ff;"">OFFLINE DATA TARGETING
</span></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>CRM Retargeting</li>
 	<li>Cross-channel Marketing</li>
 	<li>Ad Suppression</li>
 	<li>Look-alike Modeling</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style=""color: #0000ff;"">OFFLINE DATA MEASUREMENT</span></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Closed-loop Measurement</li>
 	<li>Cross-channel Attribution</li>
</ul>
To ensure data onboarding success, there are three key characteristics to gauge when working with a match partner:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Match Rate</strong>--Measured as a % of the offline
data matched to an online user, industry match
rates currently fall between 30-55%</li>
 	<li><strong>Accuracy</strong>--Measured based on how often the
onboarding provider can correctly match offline
data to an online user profile</li>
 	<li><strong>Integration</strong>--Turnaround time is important, and,
because cookies age, matching is an ongoing
commitment</li>
</ul>

2447,Should You Consider Using Beacons?,"<em>Contributed by <strong>Jonathan Mellinger, VP of Enterprise Partnerships at Goodway Group</strong></em>

<img class=""alignright wp-image-2450 "" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/iStock_000004363573_Medium-300x267.jpg"" alt="""" width=""252"" height=""210"" />
<h3>Getting started with “Proximity Marketing”</h3>
There has been a lot of buzz about beacons in the last year. You may have even read an article or two on high-profile companies like Lord &amp; Taylor or McDonald’s testing beacons in their stores. First, it should be noted that proximity marketing is a very new industry segment. In baseball terms, the second batter is up in the first inning of a nine inning game—it’s a very nascent business. But startups in this space have already begun to differentiate their products, platforms, and business models, so much so that it presents a challenge for marketers to choose which vendor works best. The goal of this blog post is to help you better understand this new marketing-technology niche.
<h4>What are beacons?</h4>
Beacons are small devices that emit a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signal. When a Bluetooth-enabled mobile device passes within range of the beacon’s signal, it communicates with beacon-enabled mobile apps, determines the mobile device’s proximity and Device ID, and sends personalized notifications and content to a customer’s smartphone.
<h4>How do beacons work?</h4>
Beacons rely on first- and third-party mobile apps to detect their signal, which then triggers a notification on a customer’s smartphone. Retailers with their own apps can install a beacon vendor’s SDK—basically a few lines of code—in their apps that allows the beacons in the store to talk to the app. Other beacon vendors partner with mobile apps who install their SDK. This allows marketers without their own apps to also communicate with potential customers.
<h4>Are Beacons Right for my Business?</h4>
Beacons are ideal for retailers and large venues. For the purpose of this post, I’m focusing on retailers because of the myriad of marketing applications. Brick-and-mortar retailers are best positioned to take advantage of beacons and proximity marketing for several reasons:

<strong>Foot traffic</strong>—It’s much easier to develop an audience for targeting or a sample size for measurement when 1,000 customers come through your store doors each day. Beacons also can collect business intelligence.

<strong>Mobile apps</strong>—Beacon vendors have their own software development kit (SDK)—remember, essentially a few lines of code—that retailers can install in their own app, allowing it to communicate with beacons placed around their stores.

<strong>Customer engagement</strong>—Beacons provide marketers a new tool to communicate with their customers. For example, if a national paint retailer has its own mobile app and beacons deployed at its stores and wants to promote a launch of a new line of home paint, when a browsing customer enters the range of the beacon, he or she can receive a notification about the new line of paint and see a “design idea” photo gallery—all from within the retailer’s mobile app. This is just one example of how retailers can creatively enhance engagement with their customers.

<strong>Attribution</strong>—Beacons provide one more touch point in the customer journey and will allow us to more accurately measure lift in store traffic from online campaigns.

Proximity-marketing beacons spent the last couple years as “bleeding edge” technology. As many retailers have tested them and beacon companies have improved their product and platform offerings, they now have graduated to “cutting edge.” In subsequent posts, I’ll explain the differences between vendors and provide more sophisticated examples of beacon-marketing programs.

2469,6 Tips for Managing a Virtual Workforce,"<strong>Goodway Group Has a 98% Virtual Workforce in 36 States</strong>

How many hours per week are spent in traffic? On gas money? Missed family dinners due to working late? Telecommuting and virtual workspaces solve these problems and much more. In the past 10 years, there has been a <a href=""https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">103 percent spike in virtual workforces</a>, and <a href=""https://www.aon.com/attachments/thought-leadership/bts_2009_results.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">44 percent of U.S. companies</a> say they are currently looking to increase their work-from-home staff. It’s no longer a fad but a legitimate and growing trend in the business world today.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goodway Group</a> knows change. In 2006, it took 77 years of being a traditional print company and turned it into a 100 percent digital ad tech firm. It was then that leadership decided to go all virtual, and in the past year have increased their workforce by 50 percent. Currently, Goodway Group has 290 employees, 284 of which work from home in 36 states across the U.S.: a 98 percent virtual workforce. However, implementing remote work places doesn’t happen overnight. For Goodway Group, it was a three-year process. As an industry leader in the digital advertising space, how do they sustain themselves while creating a successful work environment?

“We manage our virtual workforce in four ways: culture, people, process, and tools,” says Jay Friedman, Goodway’s chief operating officer. “Our culture is such that we don’t treat those who work from home any differently than if they were in a centralized office setting. We conduct significant screening before hiring to make sure the candidate is a good fit, our processes are built around being remote, notes are taken at every meeting and shared/documented, and we use tools that make remote collaboration much easier.”

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2471 size-large"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GG-Employee-Map-1024x574.png"" alt=""GG Employee Map"" width=""1024"" height=""574"" />

As an experienced virtual workforce leader, Friedman has six key tips for managing a virtual workforce:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Use the right tools</strong>: Providing employees with the right tools for success is of the utmost importance. There are so many tools that allow virtual workforces to maintain and even exceed typical productivity benchmarks. These include Office 365, Yammer, Skype for Business, Confluence, OneDrive, and Reviewsnap. These connectivity suites allow simultaneous, multi-user editing and collaboration.</li>
 	<li><strong>Treat all employees the same</strong>: It is necessary not to treat remote employees any differently. They can’t be seen as exceptions or special cases. They should have the same expectations of them as they would in a traditional office setting.</li>
 	<li><strong>Establish rules</strong>: In a physical space, it’s easier to establish the basic rules of the office. With a virtual workforce, this can be more difficult, but it’s necessary to have firm rules of conduct. For instance, working remotely is not the same as flex-time. If employees are going to be away from their desk, they need to notify a supervisor, just like in a traditional office.</li>
 	<li><strong>Cultural symbols</strong>: If a company thrives on cultural symbolism, such as awarding perks for high-achieving employees, keep in mind that virtual companies don’t have prime parking spaces in the lot out back to give away. The same goes for birthday gatherings and group employee outings. Virtual companies must make it up to their staff in other ways.</li>
 	<li><strong>Remote leaders</strong>: If some of a company’s staff work remotely and some don’t, it’s important for the organizations’ leadership to set an example of working remotely from time to time, as well as being in the office. This shows that the company leadership does not favor one type of working environment over another.</li>
 	<li><strong>Virtual process</strong>: It’s important to make sure the company’s particular business model lines up with the option of having a remote workforce. If the organization’s process and way of conducting business require all employees to be in a centralized office, having remote employees will never be the best option. In addition, constant communication, documentation of everything, and storing notes in a centralized location for everyone to view are necessary steps in the virtual process.</li>

2560,Goodway Group Debuts Validate360™,"<h4><strong>First-in-industry product suite to validate actual offline sales and in-store visits</strong></h4>
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goodway Group</a>, a managed services programmatic media firm serving hundreds of advertising agencies and marketers across North America, has announced Validate360™, a product suite measuring actual sales and in-store visits against digital advertising spend and delivery. Validate360 is an industry first and functions as a value-added service designed to track digital ad campaigns and their effectiveness at influencing actual purchasing decisions.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/capabilities/validate360/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-2561 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Validate360-intro.jpg"" alt=""Validate360 intro"" width=""1005"" height=""566"" /></a>

”Brick-and-mortar advertisers who rely on more than e-commerce have been waiting 20 years for a validation product suite that can measure true offline sales and store visits in a control vs. exposed, scientific manner,” said Jay Friedman, COO at Goodway Group. “Establishing the right data connections and algorithms took just under two years, but this will power the next decade in driving better ROI for our clients.”

Whether the purchase is an automobile, traditional consumer packaged goods, dinner at a quick-serve restaurant, or clothing from a major retailer, Validate360 measures the lift between control and exposed groups with statistical confidence and significance. In addition, in-store visits can be captured without bothering the consumer or relying on often-false self-reported consumer data about their advertising awareness.

At a time where consumers’ concern over their privacy is at an all-time high, Goodway Group is quick to point out the anonymity and trustworthiness of its data. Jonathan Mellinger, Goodway’s vice president of enterprise partnerships explains, “Goodway Group has been family-owned for 87 years. There have been prior solutions that didn’t meet our privacy standards, but Validate360 provides consumers with 100 percent anonymity and privacy guarantees. We wouldn’t have it any other way.”

Validate360 operates as a true turnkey solution, offering an immersive view of the actual effectiveness of the digital ad campaign life cycle. What begins as a targeted ad and ends with an in-store purchasing decision can now be assigned, tracked, verified, and reported. From there, results can be matched directly to the original dollar amount of the digital media buy and compared to the total ad spend for a particular campaign.

In addition, Goodway technology now has the ability to perform a “seed and replicate” technique to reach targeted consumers across any of their device platforms.

2625,Snapchat: An Overview and Ad Opportunities,"<em>Contributed by <strong>Ashton Gary, Director, Account Strategy at Goodway Group</strong></em>
<h4><span style=""color: #000000;"">
<img class=""alignright wp-image-2627"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/iStock_000080218785_Web-300x200.jpg"" alt=""iStock_000080218785_Web"" width=""375"" height=""250"" />SNAPCHAT
</span></h4>
With Snapchat monopolizing the share of time Millennials and GenZ spend in social media, marketers are scrambling to learn more about how to advertise on Snapchat. In short, Snapchat's advertising offering is still in its infancy, and advertising opportunities change frequently. Snapchat has recently launched a self-serve platform allowing users and/or brands to pay to create their own geofilters. For $5, users can log in and submit a filter they have created for use in their own Snaps with their friends. Brands can also create and submit a branded filter for consumers to use. The cost will vary based on the geos the brand selects, and how long they want the filter to be available.
<h4><span style=""color: #000000;"">History</span></h4>
In July 2011, Evan Spiegel launched Picaboo, a photo-sharing app that enables users to share pictures that would disappear after 10 seconds or less with their friends. By that fall, Picaboo was renamed Snapchat, and within a year of the company's launch, it had already grown to over 100K users and was on a rapid growth trajectory. New features were added in the years  that followed: videos, texting, video chat, shareable geofilters, Snapcash, and a Discover section for publishers, such as CNN, Discovery, and ESPN, to share content. As of Q1 2016, Snapchat has over 100MM daily active users, viewing 7 billion videos every day.

B2B marketers’ roles are changing. They must understand their buyers by leveraging the unique advantages of programmatic media: economies of scale, layering of insights and data, and cost-effectiveness. More than half of US B2B marketers already buy advertising programmatically and 40% plan to dedicate between ¼ to ½ of their media budget to programmatic in 2016.

<h3>Goodway Group Provides Innovative Gender Model for Industry</h3>
Amidst talk of the gender pay gap raging through America comes another sobering statistic. The high-tech industry is a virtual Boys' Club, with approximately <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/women-in-tech-the-numbers-dont-add-up/"">70 percent of the workforce made up of men</a>. However, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com"">Goodway Group</a> is bucking this trend.

Our programmatic advertising firm is blazing a new trail in the tech industry, not just with our innovative technology advances but also in the establishment of a corporate culture of gender advancement. We manage digital ad campaigns and programmatic media buying on behalf of Fortune 500 companies such as GM and McDonald’s.

Our third-generation, 87-year-old company was strictly a marketing print shop for 77 of those years. But in 2006, leadership transitioned our company’s previous successes and experience into an all-digital operation. With it came a remarkable exercise in how we would redefine our business.

From the outset of the transition, we made a vow to hire only the best of the best that the industry had to offer in order to ensure success moving forward. In implementing this strategy, we made the choice to hire top talent regardless of where these future employees resided. Many of the best and brightest, as it turns out, were female. Fast-forward 10 years, and we now have 290 full-time employees, 284 of whom work from home—a 98 percent remote workforce. Our unique makeup and corporate culture dictate our every move.

When it comes to gender, we have brought an extremely progressive approach to the hiring process. While it’s no secret that the high-tech industry is dominated by males, our virtual workforce allows us to make a concerted effort in increasing the numbers of women in the tech workforce. According to CNET, women make up <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/women-in-tech-the-numbers-dont-add-up/"">just 29 percent of the tech workforce</a>. But here at Goodway, females make up over 70 percent of our total operation. Furthermore, women comprise 50 percent of the VP-level leadership, with 20 percent holding executive leadership roles.

“In the past 10 years, we’ve undertaken major steps to reinvent ourselves into one of the top programmatic advertising firms in the U.S.,” said Jay Friedman, COO of Goodway Group. “The tenets of our corporate culture have not only dictated success but innovation and inclusion levels we hope will become the new norm in the high-tech industry.”

We enjoy an unprecedented 86 percent client retention rate, much of which can be attributed to our high employee retention, due in part to the virtual workforce model: clients value account management continuity. Our employees live by our unique and established culture and are the driving force behind its success. In the world of digital ad campaigns, we have never subscribed to the “set it and forget it” philosophy. Rather, each campaign is managed by a real human, consistently monitoring behind the scenes to manage optimal results.

2938,Goal Prioritization Is Paramount for Programmatic,"<i>Contributed by </i><strong><i>Noah Everist, Director Account Strategy, at Goodway Group</i></strong>

<img class=""alignright wp-image-2950 size-medium"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Businesspeople-300x128.png"" alt=""Businesspeople"" width=""300"" height=""128"" />What if you thought you were playing soccer? You got on your shin guards, kicked the ball around, and showed up to play but instead EVERYONE else is playing a different sport? Pretty hard to play the game to the best of your ability without knowing the ground rules, right? And if no one knows what the rules should be, it would be complete chaos. Kicking. Tackling. Ugly.

Goals help crystallize what your priorities should be in order to reach them. This process makes us more productive. It keeps us on track. It keeps us accountable.
<h4>SET AND COMMUNICATE GOALS</h4>
Goals are especially important in the programmatic landscape:
<ul>
 	<li>Programmatic works quickly. The buying process takes tenths of a second, making it challenging to adjust on the fly.</li>
 	<li>Computers are binary. Having empirical data to input is imperative. That is what they relentlessly optimize toward.</li>
 	<li>Traders need to know what a “win” is to also work toward the stated goal.</li>
</ul>
<h4>DETERMINE KPIs AND DEFINITIONS</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Determine what your business model needs to be successful in programmatic.</li>
 	<li>If you don’t know, discuss this with your programmatic partner.</li>
 	<li>Be clear about your goal definitions.
<ul>
 	<li>What does a lead mean?
<ul>
 	<li>Is it a website activity or phone call?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>OPTIMIZE TO DIFFERENT GOALS FOR DIFFERENT RESULTS</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Lead and awareness goals will use different tactics and optimize toward different metrics: viewability vs. eCPA, for example.</li>
 	<li>You may start with the same budget and timing, but you’ll have two different results based on your different goals.</li>
 	<li>Be sure your anticipated results are backed up by appropriate goals.</li>
</ul>
<h4>PRIORITIZE THE GOAL</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Pick one goal and stick to it.</li>
 	<li>If you change it during the campaign, you essentially have to start over.</li>
 	<li>Every campaign element is optimized to hit your goal—ad size, frequency, time of day, etc.</li>
 	<li>If you have multiple goals, prioritize them and ensure they are congruent with each other—leads to sales—or you’ll set up your campaign for failure.</li>
</ul>
<h4>YOUR NEEDS. YOUR GOALS.</h4>
Understanding your goals and what they mean to your organization are critical to a campaign’s success. We will ask you key questions and then ask them again to ensure we are aligned with your vision. We will encourage you to delve deep into the sales funnel so your marketing dollars are invested as efficiently as possible. When we are one team working toward the same goals . . . then, press start.

<h4>White Paper Tests Viewability’s Impact on Ad Performance</h4>
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodway Group</a>, a managed services programmatic media firm serving hundreds of advertising agencies and marketers across North America, has released a white paper titled “Applying Viewability Intelligently for Measurably Improved Performance.” The report showcases the results of an exhaustive study that analyzed more than one billion delivered impressions to understand viewability’s true impact on campaign performance, and also the importance of viewability within the many factors affecting digital media campaign results.

<span style=""color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;""><img class=""alignright wp-image-2975 size-medium"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/whitepaper-cover-232x300.jpg"" alt=""whitepaper-cover"" width=""232"" height=""300"" /></span>The research study identified four key findings:
<ol>
 	<li>Using two viewability technology companies, Goodway determined that users who are served ads that are measured as viewable convert at an 8-9% greater rate than users who are served ads that are not measured as viewable.</li>
 	<li> A large gray area exists in viewability: impressions that are measured as being in-view for some amount of time but not enough to meet the IAB standard.</li>
 	<li> Contrary to intuition, sites that have nearly 100% viewable inventory are the worst-performing sites in the programmatic ecosystem.</li>
 	<li> Viewability’s lift on performance cannot be compared with other dimensions’ lift, such as behavioral data or site/context. Viewability is instead foundational to enabling all other performance to catalyze a campaign.</li>
</ol>
“When analyzing viewability, we came to some interesting findings that mostly have to do with the complexities that are built into our industry,” explained Jay Friedman, COO of Goodway Group. “Viewability has become a buzzword and a default for marketers, but we found that when campaigns are built solely around viewability, they often miss the mark to the detriment of advertisers. For example, our data shows that 100% viewability doesn’t automatically lead to conversions. It’s more nuanced than that. The programmatic ecosystem requires that multiple factors, including viewability, are considered to achieve optimal campaign results.”

The report calls out inconsistencies among viewability measurement companies, various paths to conversion, and unethical industry practices such as “cookie-bombing” as all contributing to the current distorted understanding of viewability and its effect on campaigns.

To help marketers apply the findings, the report provides some guidance including adopting a multidimensional approach when executing campaigns and not focusing too much on any one specific area, concentrating on good creative and placing it in effective media vehicles, accepting a margin of error when it comes to viewability, and cherry-picking viewable inventory in the private marketplace.

<h3><img class=""alignright wp-image-3021 "" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/iStock_000064110935_Double-300x200.jpg"" alt=""mobility and modern lifestyle concept: young woman reading a trends blog at the park"" width=""213"" height=""143"" />Ad-mageddon? The end of digital advertising as we know it? The end of the free Internet?</h3>
Although much hyped and hotly debated across the industry, ad blockers do not signify the end of digital advertising. However, they certainly are having an impact and will spur change across the digital ad industry. So what are ad blockers, how do they work, and what are we going to do about it?
<h3>WHAT ARE AD BLOCKERS?</h3>
An ad blocker is any type of tool, app, or plug-in that stops ad content from being downloaded before a web browser fully loads.

Although there has been an explosion in ad blocking services over the past year, this isn’t a new issue as desktop and Android ad blockers have been around for many years.
<h3>WHAT DO AD BLOCKERS BLOCK?</h3>
Right now, they target the more “intrusive” types of ads, such as pop-ups and high-impact ads, as well as certain types of tracking codes that provide data on how a user interacts with a page.

However, some ad blockers can remove banners, sponsored posts, pre-roll, YouTube ads, and Facebook Sponsored Stories.
<h3>HOW DO AD BLOCKERS WORK?</h3>
<ol>
 	<li>A person downloads and runs an ad blocking application (most often a plug-in or browser extension).</li>
 	<li>That person opens their browser and visits a website.</li>
 	<li>While the webpage is loading, the blocker looks at the site, compares it to a list it was built to block, and if it finds any ads, it blocks them.</li>
</ol>
<img class=""alignnone wp-image-3027 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ad-block-phone.png"" alt=""ad block phone"" width=""384"" height=""350"" />

<img class=""alignnone wp-image-3028 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/ad-block-graphic.png"" alt=""ad block graphic"" width=""598"" height=""321"" />
<h3>HOW MANY PEOPLE USE AD BLOCKERS?</h3>
There is no reliable consensus on exactly how many people are using ad blockers today. However, we know the number is growing.

Ad block usage grew in the United States by 48% last year, according to a report by PageFair and Adobe. The same report indicates that 16% of the US online population blocked ads last year, equating to an estimated loss of $10B in revenue.

A comScore and Sourcepoint report from June 2015 states that ad blockers tend to be millennials and have higher incomes.
<h3>POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS ON YOUR CAMPAIGNS?</h3>
It’s important to point out that this is largely a publisher concern, and they’re well aware of it. They know exactly how much advertising traffic is being blocked and the methods the ad blockers are using. There are two potential implications:
<ol>
 	<li>There may be a reduction in available inventory because blocking ads reduces total available inventory.</li>
 	<li>There may be an increase in reporting discrepancies since a client ad server may be blocked while the vendor ad server is not.</li>
</ol>
At Goodway, our partners don’t need to worry about paying for blocked ads. Ads that are blocked are not registered as impressions by our ad server, so we don’t ever pay for them.
<h3>WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF AD BLOCKERS?</h3>
No one can be certain the full impact that ad blockers will have in years to come. Content is not free, so unless the web moves to a 100% paid access model, digital ads are here to stay.

Publishers are focused on creating a better user experience through more relevant ads and lighter website load times. We are in a transition period, and these blockers will continue to push the industry and publishers to put user experience first.

Check out the <a href=""https://www.kpcb.com/blog/2016-internet-trends-report?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTURsalpERXhObVF6Wm1VMiIsInQiOiJRWHhWcE9kNmFkb3VCemx1RzBOQjY5Y0FYK3NPVmwycnZxSDRPMURFR1JDdDQ1eTRzU2pYV0RoeXhQWGorc25PT0tueUQycUVGbk9kTjZjekUwSVFZd2FyYzRzY2Q4c2hvU2U0MkxJdVRZST0ifQ%3D%3D"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2016 Internet Trends report </a>from renowned industry analyst, Mary Meeker.

At 213 slides, the full report still might be too much to chew. Instead, let us give you a digest of the top five trends that are shaping the future of digital advertising:
<h4>1. Don’t judge flat growth rates too harshly.</h4>
While Meeker suggests the global Internet adoption rate has plateaued, we’ll remind you that nine percent growth year over year is nearly 643 million new users, with 58 percent of the world’s population still at large. And despite many opinions that developing nations will go straight to mobile when they are ready to access the Internet, reports on Middle East/Africa smartphone growth show the cost-to-income ratio is still too high.

<h4>2. Did video kill the radio ad?</h4>
Not quite. As traditional and non-tech behemoths push to stay relevant, they are acquiring start-up tech companies to facilitate their transition into the digital market. Yet their advertising budgets remain staked in media of the past. Despite the fact that audience attention has shifted—consumers are now spending 47 percent of their time on the Internet/mobile—the majority of advertisers continue to funnel disproportionate dollars into legacy outlets, like print and TV.

Still, overall Internet ad revenue hit $60 billion in 2015, with nearly two-thirds of revenue coming from desktop ads. That’s not to say mobile isn’t exploding too—mobile ad revenue grew by more than 66 percent in 2015. For those early adopters ready to take advantage of the untapped $21 billion mobile market, hyper-targeted ads and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">cross device targeting </a>will ensure their spend hits the right consumers, at the right time, with the right message.

<h4>3. Welcome to the visual era.</h4>
At 27 percent, Millennials are now the largest segment of the population. Combine that with their propensity to “earn to spend,” and their consumer relevance will grow dramatically as they reach full adulthood. While newcomers, like Snapchat and Instagram, fulfill the Millennial visual penchant, Facebook still overwhelmingly holds their attention best. Advertisers will need to know <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/snapchat-an-overview-and-ad-opportunities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">how to build visual experiences </a>within these platforms if they want to capitalize on Millennial (and soon to come Generation Z) buying power.

<h4>4. Your voice is more powerful than ever.</h4>
The average person types only 40 words per minute but speaks at a rate of 150 words per minute, so it comes as no surprise that voice will be the next major user interface. Today, one in five searches on Android devices are voice-activated, largely due to its hands-free and vision-free complement to our on-the-go lifestyles. As voice assistants (think Siri and Amazon Echo) continue to improve in accuracy and latency, Meeker suggests at least 50 percent of all searches will be image- or speech-based within five years.

<h4>5. Are we fighting or fueling cybercrime?</h4>
Privacy remains a global concern for both consumers and businesses alike, but exploding data usage and “always-listening” voice-command devices are blurring the line between fighting and fueling cybercrimes.

3173,Proximity Marketing–What You Need to Know,"<i>Contributed by </i><strong><i>Jonathan Mellinger, VP of Enterprise Partnerships at Goodway Group</i></strong>

<img class=""alignright wp-image-3183"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/iStock_000085943203_PeopleShoppingClothing-200x300.jpg"" alt=""iStock_000085943203_PeopleShoppingClothing"" width=""252"" height=""375"" />

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">In my last blog post</a>, I explained what beacons were, how they worked, and what types of businesses could use beacons. In this post, I’ll explore considerations that retailers should be mindful of as they develop their proximity marketing solution.

The app accesses the customer’s phone’s Bluetooth capabilities (presuming they have them enabled), which allows delivery of a message from the retailer. If we examine this process more closely, there’s really a lot going on:
<ul>
 	<li>First, we are using an app to trigger the engagement experience. But which app? It could be the retailer’s owned-and-operated (O&amp;O) app, or it could be one of many third-party “lifestyle” apps that have partnered with the beacon provider as part of a “network”. Some beacon providers have partnered with an “anchor” app that has tens of millions of active users, like a popular coupon or shopping app. For simplicity’s sake, let’s presume we’re using the retailer’s O&amp;O loyalty app. This presents an ideal use case, one in which the retailer has an engaged and active user base.</li>
 	<li>Retailers are obviously sensitive to their customers’ in-store experience. So it’s natural for retailers to ask, “How many of my customers are receptive to this type of messaging?” According to an eMarketer survey from August 2015 (<a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Retailers-Eye-Value-Beacon-Data/1012841"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Beacons for Retailers, Beyond the Hype</a>), about 65% of consumers are willing to have stores access their Bluetooth to track them. Swirl, a beacon company, notes that about 60% of people have their Bluetooth permissions enabled. These two stats illustrate a meaningful portion of the population is both enabled and willing to engage with in-store messaging.</li>
 	<li>A recent study from eMarketer cites “in-store engagement” as being the top channel for customer engagement by retailers. This dovetails nicely to our final part of the process—communicating with customers. At <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goodway</a>, we are proponents of maximizing the value exchange between retailers and their customers. If retailers are going to access a person’s smartphone, then they must share high-value content with their customer. Beacons present an entirely new channel of communication with a customer. The rich engagement that is possible shouldn’t be squandered on coupons; rather, we should encourage clients to provide content relevant to their customers when they’re in the store. New product launches, specialty items, and co-marketing or promotions are great examples of content that can educate and enhance a customer’s in-store experience.</li>
</ul>
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">As I mentioned in my previous blog post</a>, proximity marketing is still a nascent market. Beacon vendors or solutions providers are still shoring up their product offerings. By addressing these considerations as part of a proximity marketing strategy, retailers will be able to winnow their vendor choices to ones with a platform that meets their needs and requirements.

3288,Why Understanding How Fraud Is Reported Matters,"<em>Contributed by <strong>Amanda Benoist, Marketing Content Strategist at Goodway Gro</strong></em><strong>up</strong>

<img class=""alignnone wp-image-3294 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Quote.png"" alt=""Quote"" width=""800"" height=""261"" />
For years, digital advertising agencies and their clients have seen billions lost to inefficiencies caused by fraudulent impressions. In 2016 alone, ad fraud will cost the programmatic ad industry $7.2 billion, according to a <a href=""https://www.ana.net/content/show/id/botfraud-2016"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent ANA finding</a>. While many advertisers have written this off as the cost to play the game, <a href=""https://www.imediaconnection.com/article/229015/160413-chloe-della-costa-marketers-confess-the-one-thing-id-change-about-the-industry"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">others recommend a better understanding</a> of how invalid traffic is reported in order to begin making a measurable impact in the fight against fraud.

We are now at a point where we know <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39DUE3clyYo"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ad fraud is multi-dimensional</a>. Non-human traffic, or simple bots, were a primary concern ten years ago, but advertisers today also have to be wary of sophisticated bots, click farms, invisible ads, user anomalies, and much more. And the more sophisticated fraudsters get, the more difficult it is for suppliers and regulating agencies to clearly identify instances of fraud. So how does your programmatic partner know what to buy and what not to buy anymore?

First, it’s not easy—there is a lot of gray area. An ad space that looks suspicious but can’t be easily or quickly labeled as fraud might make it into the inventory for one supplier, but not another. For example, past research has measured approximately 38% of all SSP programmatic traffic as invalid. Before you start to throw the baby out with the bathwater, consider this: leading ad verification agency <a href=""https://integralads.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IAS_Q1-2016_US_MediaQualityReport.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Integral Ad Science</a> has also reported seeing only 8.3% of fraud among SSP inventory. Who is right?

It depends on your risk tolerance. If you draw the fraud circle too wide, you may lose out on acceptable inventory and scalability. On the other hand, too much tolerance drives questionable placements and awkward questions from your clients.

The reality is most DSPs filter out fraudulent traffic fairly well, but user anomalies still account for a significant amount of fraud that bypasses traditional fraud filters and exchange-level controls. This is questionable inventory that doesn’t meet the strict definition of fraud, for instance, a site that goes from 0 views to 80k views in a single month. Only discerning human analysis can identify suspicious activities like these.

Ultimately, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goodway-group-achieves-tag-iqg-certification/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">experience matters when addressing the challenges of digital advertising fraud</a>. When it comes to identifying and removing fraud, Goodway is even more aggressive than top fraud protection companies. This year, we launched an advanced anti-fraud initiative based on the results from a comprehensive review of our supply ecosystem for invalid traffic and user anomalies. After analyzing billions of bid request data points and purchased impressions through a 10-dimensional algorithm, <strong>Goodway has seen fraud results as low as 1% become a reality</strong>.

As children, many of us eagerly participated in the whodunit stories of <em>The Boxcar Children</em>, <em>Nancy Drew</em>, <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, and <em>The</em> <em>Hardy Boys</em>. We cultivated our inner sleuth solving the case alongside our fictional friends, and dreamed of being just like them. While most of us never donned a smoking pipe or magnifying glass as adults, some of us still became detectives of sorts.

Throughout my career as a data scientist, I’ve uncovered a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW2W9cv-K2Q"">variety of programmatic ad fraud plots </a>and foiled more than a couple nefarious individuals online. At Goodway Group, my job is to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goodway-group-achieves-tag-iqg-certification/"">team up </a>systematic defense mechanisms for preventing invalid traffic with vigilant human monitoring against anomalies. Basically, I use those code-cracking skills from my youth to get hot on the trail of fraudsters; then I call in my gang of analysts to scour the online scene for suspicious characters.

What does this really mean in the world of programmatic media? I’ll give you the CliffsNotes:

<strong>The Plot</strong>: Pretend that you are running a video campaign to soccer moms in the Midwest. Delivery is hitting its daily goals, performance is knocking it out of the park, and viewability is over 75%. Sounds too good to be true, right? Then, it probably is.

<strong>Returning to the Scene of the Crime</strong>: First, Goodway Group partnered with Pixalate, an industry leader in programmatic fraud detection, to automatically blacklist troublesome domains and IP addresses on a daily basis from our campaigns. However, using third-party data only gets us so far in solving this ad fraud mystery.

<strong>Following the Clues</strong>: Beyond applying Pixalate data, our team of data detectives and machine-learning algorithms investigated every ad served in the campaign using impression-level data. From questionable characteristics on domains to the users we serve impressions to, we analyzed every piece of evidence, including hard-to-detect domain registry fraud and bogus social activities.

<strong>Narrowing in on the Suspects</strong>: In this case, our villain registered a maze of domains and set loose an army of click bots to hide his shady efforts at ad theft, but he was no match for our information logic. By tracing our swindler’s IP address, we were able to wipe out the entire fraud ring at once, blacklisting all sites hosted on that same IP address.

<strong>All in a Day’s Work</strong>: Catching the bad guys isn't the only happy ending for Goodway Group. Where the programmatic ecosystem comes in with 8.3% fraudulent inventory and site directs show 2.4% ad fraud, <a href=""https://www.prweb.com/releases/2016/07/prweb13533406.htm"">Goodway Group was recently measured at only .96% invalid traffic</a>, according to leading ad verification company Integral Ad Science. The moral of the story: We offer our clients programmatic campaigns at a lower fraud percentage than if they ran their ads with the sites directly!

While I may not carry a badge, a gun, or a magnifying glass, for that matter, I know I’m doing my part to police the online superhighway and keep our clients' programmatic campaigns safe.

I bet you’ve fielded a call or two in the past week from executives asking how local restaurants and clothing stores become Pokéstops or who to call at Niantic to sign <a href=""https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/growlithe"">Growlithe</a> for their next dog food commercial.

Despite all the buzz that Pokémon Go is creating around your office and across the globe, programmatic monetization to capitalize on the game’s popularity is still in the earliest stages of development. John Hanke, chief executive of Niantic, hinted to <em><a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic9YLO96fOAhWCRyYKHXSFCzEQFggoMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F75942b12-48ba-11e6-b387-64ab0a67014c.html&amp;usg=AFQjCNHDh2yh3Df3gtotXvCZtFWRvZumng&amp;sig2=T8Lr38AT68-GkK2XnA1ONQ"">Financial Times</a></em> that sponsored locations are coming soon to Pokémon Go, but, in the meantime, there are other creative ways to get your brick-and-mortar clients into the game.
<h4>Drive Foot Traffic in the Door</h4>
What makes Pokémon Go an in-store goldmine is that it wasn’t created to enable users to engage on their phones alone. It requires players to explore and interact with the physical world in order to advance in the game.

This opens up retailers and public spaces to increased foot traffic. Since the game requires GPS-enablement, storefronts can buy in-app tools, like <a href=""https://support.pokemongo.nianticlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/222049307-Glossary"">Lures</a> that attract Pokémon creatures, to entice nearby hunters to come inside. At $1 each to activate (or less, if purchased in bulk), Lure placements are extremely cost-effective for quick-service business owners, like ice cream shops and boutiques, to experiment with immediately.
<h4>Enrich Your Customer Database</h4>
Mining smartphone activities for corporate CRMs is not a new concept. Since Foursquare launched the “check-in” nearly seven years ago, thousands of apps have linked users’ mobile habits to their CRM profiles. Yet, Pokémon Go has surpassed every other location-based application’s ability to capture the behaviors and preferences of its users.

While a few have noted Pokémon Go’s policy is broader than most apps—requiring access to not just users’ locations and cameras but also to their Google accounts in some cases—most players are still downloading the game faster than a <a href=""https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/rapidash"">Rapidash</a>. But until the Pokémon Go mobile app becomes <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/proximity-marketing-need-know/"">beacon-enabled </a>for third parties, business owners must rely on their own geofencing techniques to capture potential customers hunting nearby.

By working with a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/"">programmatic media partner</a>, your clients can set up geofences to accurately identify and serve ads to players within a specific radius of their store. Geofencing tools can then segment these potential customers into a custom audience within their CRM. Based on user behaviors in the real world, businesses can further <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/connecting-offline-data-for-online-success/"">build their extensive database of users</a>, tagging each into specific categories such as “fast food lovers,” “movie goers”, or “<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/case-study/texas-auto-dealers/"">truck enthusiasts</a>.”
<h4>Power Hyper-Relevant Messages</h4>
It comes as no surprise that location-based advertising is going to be a significant portion of the game’s future revenue base. However, we also know traditional pop-up ads would destroy Pokémon Go’s augmented reality environment. Instead, Hanke shared that upcoming location sponsorships will likely be charged on a “cost per visit” basis, similar to the “cost per click” used in Google’s search advertising.

Until location sponsorships and other corporate advertising opportunities are available, how can your clients jump on the bandwagon and connect digitally with potential customers hunting in the area?

As shared above, marketers can use geo-fences to pinpoint those who enter inside of a defined radius, such as within a few feet of a particular storefront. Then, they can serve up hyper-relevant ads that share content with those users that will educate or enhance the in-store experience. Using the enriched data captured and identified by the geofence, businesses can also retarget those customers after their hunt with special offers, reminders about new product launches, and other messages to drive repeat visits.

Now is the time to encourage your clients to get inventive. Play the game on your own. Look for PokéStops or Gyms nearby. Capitalize on the game’s popularity. Use those learnings in combination with <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"">advances in geofencing</a> to track users, target new audiences, and share ads that are important to customers’ interests.

In the end, there’s no denying that Pokémon Go has nailed the entertainment space. It’s nostalgic, yet cutting edge. It’s addictive, yet playable in short bursts, like on the bus-ride to work. It’s easy to learn, yet the adrenaline rush of catching a Pokémon creature keeps players coming back for more. But it’s still too soon to tell if Pokémon Go’s upcoming branded experiences will also nail the programmatic advertising space.",,8/3/16 20:55,post,https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/gotta-catch-em-potential-customers/,https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trio-on-their-cell-phones-300x200.jpg,Trio-on-their-cell-phones-300x200.jpg,/nas/content/live/prodgoodway/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trio-on-their-cell-phones-300x200.jpg,10988,Trio-on-their-cell-phones-300x200,,,,,Digital Strategy,geofencing,Pokemon Go has become an instant success.

We’re now a little more than halfway through the Rio 2016 Olympics, and it’s been an amazing journey so far. We were excited to watch the United States' wins and can’t wait to see what the second week of the Olympics brings. In the meantime, we’ve reviewed stats for the top three social media platforms and awarded them medals based on their 2012 versus 2016 Olympics engagement. Overall, the Olympics engagement numbers mirror the maturity and audience of each platform.

<h4>3) BRONZE</h4>
The bronze medal goes to Twitter. <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-revenue-growth-dwindles-outlook-disappoints-1469564731"">Twitter has been struggling to gain more users</a>, and it shows in the number of followers for the official Olympics Twitter accounts—the Rio 2016 accounts have only 3.78% more followers than the London 2012 account. However, engagement on the platform is up as the Rio 2016 accounts have posted 26,000 tweets, a 640% increase over the London 2012.
<h4>2) SILVER</h4>
Facebook takes the silver medal here. Page likes are up 105% for the official Rio page versus the official London page. User post engagement has decreased slightly, with 2.5% fewer users discussing #londonolympics versus #rioolympics. This shows that perhaps Facebook users are becoming more passive—they are more likely to follow a page and receive news than write their own posts. This speaks to Facebook’s maturity as a platform, as it <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/"">hit 1 billion users in 2012, and currently has 1.13 billion users daily</a>.
<h4>1) GOLD</h4>
Finally, the gold medal goes to Instagram. It has a completely different trajectory than the other two platforms, and its London versus Rio comparison shows how rapidly Instagram has grown. The #london2012 hashtag has 369,696 posts while #rio2016 has 2,065,798 posts, and the 2016 Olympics are only halfway through. Instagram is a younger platform than both Twitter and Facebook, and <a href=""https://totalaccess.emarketer.com/Login.aspx?ReturnUrl=%2fArticle.aspx%3fR%3d1013612%26dsNav%3dNtk%3arelevance%257cinstagram%2bgrowth%257c1%257c%2cRo%3a1%2cN%3a406%2cNr%3aNOT(Type%253aComparative%2bEstimate)&amp;R=1013612&amp;dsNav=Ntk:relevance%7cinstagram+growth%7c1%7c,Ro:1,N:406,Nr:NOT(Type%3aComparative+Estimate)"">its growth still hasn’t peaked according to eMarketer</a>, so this explosion in posts is on par for what we’d expect to see from the platform.

3465,Why Advertisers Are Tuning into Audio Again,"&nbsp;

<img class=""alignright wp-image-3466 size-medium"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Girl-with-Headphones-Rocking-Out-300x200.jpg"" alt=""Close-up studio shot of an attractive trendy young woman with her hands on her headset"" width=""300"" height=""200"" />Do you have the perfect playlist for every situation<em>—</em>from working, to working out, to working it on the dance floor? We bet you do.

Throughout history, music has been one of the most intimate forms of individual expression. Today’s music libraries and playlists are akin to daily journals, logging a listener’s routine, aspirations, and mood at a single moment. It is because of this data richness that marketers have started changing their tune about audio ads.

Think about the playlist for your daily commute. Perhaps it provides the pep you need to get your day started, specially designed and saved on your digital streaming account. Now think about what you listen to when you are in the office. Maybe it’s a little more subdued<em>—</em>live streaming a digital radio channel by your favorite artist through your computer to act as background noise. It’s these simple choices<em>—</em>when you listen, what you listen to, and how you listen<em>—</em>that enable advertisers to tailor the perfect message for any moment in a user’s routine.

Now through the efficiency of programmatic, marketers can tap into this sea of first-party data, make powerful inferences about consumer habits, and match targeted 15- or 30-second ads to specific types of playlists, all within their existing media campaigns. Here’s how playlist targeting works: Advertisers can select from a collection of music mixes, such as party, romance, cooking, or workout, to target specific listeners who are in the right state of mind to hear about their products.

Global music streaming trailblazer, <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/news/technology/spotify-now-offering-programmatic-audio-advertising-worldwide-172605"">Spotify has already launched a programmatic audio platform</a> to enable advertisers to reach it’s 70 million free listeners, and iHeart Radio is anticipated to be close behind. With inventory sold on a flat CPM and the promise of ultra-engaged digital radio audiences expected to reach over 58% of the U.S. population by 2020 (<em>eMarketer, February 2016</em>), programmatic is primed to give audio a second life.

3485,What Is Programmatic Advertising?,"<img class=""alignright wp-image-3488 "" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GettyImages-534190260-web-210x300.jpg"" alt=""Group of young people sitting at a cafe, talking and enjoying, top view"" width=""236"" height=""329"" /><a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-programmatic-video-share-clients/"">Programmatic advertising</a> refers to a data-oriented, technology-driven, automated method of buying and selling advertising. Originally focused on digital display advertising, the ability to transact programmatically has expanded past digital display advertising to mobile, video, social, native, and even linear television. Programmatic advertising was initially created as a tool for efficiency. However, as programmatic <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/rise-programmatic-tv-explained-5-graphics/"">expands into TV</a> and other traditional mediums, the ability to precisely target audiences is gaining more importance.

Programmatic is sometimes mistaken as a way to buy/sell low-quality, remnant inventory that publishers could not sell directly. This is a misconception, as programmatic is the preferred form of transacting within the advertising ecosystem. According to eMarketer, 2015 marked the first year where more US display dollars were transacted programmatically than through traditional direct sales. While most people think RTB when they hear programmatic advertising, the marketplace is shifting to programmatic direct. According to eMarketer, in 2016 programmatic direct will account for 53% of all US programmatic ad spending.

Although programmatic layers data-driven decision making and automation into the advertising space, this does not replace the need for human decision makers in order to run a successful campaign. In truth, the need for human insights is only increased by programmatic capabilities.
<h4><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3489 size-large"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/types-of-program-inventory-1024x481.png"" alt=""types of program inventory"" width=""1024"" height=""481"" /></h4>
<h4><strong>Newer Forms of Programmatic—Native and TV</strong></h4>
Programmatic buying is leading the charge across digital display, mobile, social, and video. Data-driven audience targeting and automation are making inroads into native and television; however, the spending is still limited. Native programmatic advertising has become much easier than before, after the IAB updated OpenRTB protocols in 2015. Publishers and technology providers are moving quickly to meet a high demand for automation in the native space.
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"">Programmatic TV advertising</a> has a larger hurdle to clear, with only 1% of TV ad spending forecasted to be transacted programmatically in 2016, rising to only 6% in 2018, as reported by eMarketer. The industry must adapt to shift away from panel-based demographically transacted inventory to audience transacted inventory.","Programmatic advertising refers to a data-oriented, technology-driven, automated method of buying and selling advertising.

The report, titled “Ad Fraud in the US: How More Sophisticated Methods Are Hurting Mobile, Video, and Performance Measurement,” is a three-part series covering the latest trends in ad safety, viewability, and the impact on programmatic advertisers today.

Discussion on how to fight ad fraud and curtail its effects led to the excerpt from the report below:
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">Most digital buyers and sellers consider the use of a fraud detection or ad verification tool table stakes. But while these systems are absolutely critical to protecting against ad fraud, it’s unrealistic to expect them to be capable of catching all fraudulent activity. “Using a third-party fraud company is like taking your Vitamin C every day,” said Jay Friedman, partner and COO of Goodway Group, a programmatic media buying and planning firm. “It’s a smart decision in general, but it’s no guarantee that you’re not going to get sick.”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;"">Some, for example, only filter for invalid traffic and not sophisticated traffic. But perhaps more important is the acknowledgement that such automated processes can and do miss things that a human eye is often capable of catching—if someone takes the time to look.</p>
The report goes on to share how in early 2016 Goodway Group launched a comprehensive review of our supply ecosystem for sophisticated bots that were being programmed to look like users. Analyzing billions of programmatic bid request data points and purchased impressions through a 10-dimensional algorithm led our team to develop our own algorithms that continually detect and remove complex fraudsters from our inventory. Our final result? Goodway has seen fraud rates as low as 1% become a reality.

In a politically charged election year, it becomes increasingly apparent how impactful advertising budgets can be on primary outcomes. This same effect holds true for elections of all sizes, whether presidential, gubernatorial, local officials, or even ballot measures. Political spending in digital is increasing rapidly, with particular acceleration each election year. Borrell Associates estimates that political advertisers will spend $1 billion on digital advertising in 2016, rising to $3.2 billion in 2020.
<h4>Areas of Opportunity</h4>
<strong>Local Campaign Spend Growing Quickly</strong>

Local campaigns for politicians, ballots, or initiatives will grow quickest, as the smaller operations will look to digital to access better targeting on smaller budgets. According to Borrell Associates:

<img class=""wp-image-3526 size-medium aligncenter"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/digital-politics-spend-300x75.png"" alt=""digital politics spend"" width=""300"" height=""75"" />

<strong>Social’s Sought After</strong>

Social inventory is highly prized by advertisers, as consumers look here for political news and updates and to stay active in conversations taking place. According to a Lab42 study, 53.6% of U.S. Internet users will use social media to research and learn about political candidates prior to elections.
<ul>
 	<li>Millennials in particular favor this medium and ought to be a focus as this demographic becomes a growing portion of the electorate.</li>
 	<li>Minorities, Hispanics in particular, also largely access and heavily participate on social platforms.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Missing Out on Mobile</strong>

Mobile is a missed opportunity and will be the next frontier for political dollars. As reported by eMarketer, mobile comprised 53% of digital ad spending in 2015, but only 6% of registered voters saw ads on mobile.

3537,The Scoop on Sourced Traffic,"<i>Contributed by </i><strong><i>Noah Everist, Director, Account Strategy at Goodway Group</i></strong><img class=""wp-image-3541 size-thumbnail alignright"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Getty-sourced-traffic-150x150.jpg"" alt=""Shot of a businessman using a laptop in an office"" width=""150"" height=""150"" />
<h5>What is Sourced Traffic?</h5>
Sourced traffic is any method by digital media sellers to get visitors via third parties, and the tactic is commonly used to reach audience guarantees for digital ad campaigns, also commonly known as audience extension.<strong>*</strong>
<h5>Marketers Unaware of Sourced Traffic Issues</h5>
Many clients and advertisers take deals with direct sites at face value as they are not aware of this inventory procurement method. Per <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"">eMarketer</a>, only about 40% of clients are familiar with the concept of sourced traffic, and over 50% of clients do not know if sourced traffic is part of their buys. This hampers knowing what inventory is actually, and actually not, providing results for their campaigns.

Per an ANA and White Ops study, sourced traffic was estimated to be 52% fraudulent, about 5x more than all digital traffic. High-profile and well-known sites were not immune to this phenomenon.<strong>**</strong>
<h5>Protecting Yourself<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">—</span></span>Buyer Beware</h5>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Read the agreements</strong>. If you work with publishers directly, read the agreements. Understand how they go about audience extension or source third-party traffic, and ask about how they prevent fraud. Negotiate that they will not source traffic, or that they will disclose what traffic they are sourcing.</li>
 	<li><strong>Be skeptical</strong>. If a site with a small audience sends you guaranteed impressions that seem way too big of a number for them to fulfill, they are probably using sourced traffic.</li>
 	<li><strong>Demand transparency</strong>. Don’t be afraid to look through the third-party ad server reporting. Chances are, if they are not transparent, something is being hidden for a reason.</li>
 	<li><strong>Utilize outside resources</strong>. Be sure that you utilize a third-party fraud partner. And measure viewability!</li>
 	<li><strong>Align your goals</strong>. Set your goals as deep within your purchase funnel as possible. This helps protect against fraud and improves campaign performance.</li>
 	<li><strong>Include a human element</strong>. Don't completely trust the computers; have a skilled trader analyze your traffic flow.</li>
 	<li><strong>Work within the system</strong>. If their sourced traffic is appropriate for your target/goals, continue to monitor and negotiate a better price on that traffic.</li>
</ul>

Most likely your favorite team, tasty appetizers to share, and the commercials. As millions of Americans pulled their jerseys out of the closet and set their fantasy lineups this past weekend, marketers across the country held their breath.

It makes sense that marketers look to capitalize on the football season. According to the NFL, the average game gets over 20 million viewers, accounting for <a href=""https://nflcommunications.com/PublishingImages/Pages/2015-REGULAR-SEASON-RATINGS-RECAP-/2015%20Regular%20Season%20Ratings%20Recap.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">46 of the top 50 most-watched fall shows on TV.*</a> And that’s just for the regular season.

With playoff numbers only going up and culminating with America’s most-watched show ever<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">—</span></span>the Super Bowl<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">—</span></span>it’s no surprise advertisers are willing to shell out <a href=""https://adage.com/article/media/nfl-staggering-ad-prices-2015-16-season/300376/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">over $625,000 for a 30-second spot on Sunday Night Football.**</a> However, great marketers know these high-priced commercials don’t happen in a vacuum.

Big games aren’t just talked about around the water cooler anymore. People search their smartphones for player stats. They update their fantasy lineup on their tablets. And they text their friends with memes from the biggest plays<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">—</span></span>all while watching the big game.

As consumers spread their attention across more and more screens and channels during the game, commercials must be interconnected with social media, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-programmatic-advertising/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">programmatic display</a>, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">geotargeting</a>, and many other modern campaign tactics to capture and hold the consumer’s attention. Here’s a look at three campaign strategies that will score big with consumers across all channels:

<strong>Make Mobile Your MVP</strong>.<strong>
</strong>With over 90% of millennials and 85% of Generation X using at least two screens while watching television,*** it’s safe to assume that smartphones will play a significant role in your reach. Start by making sure all of your landing pages are small screen-friendly to ensure successful conversion of your ads post-click.

Once you’ve covered the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">mobile basics</a>, consider other unique approaches. For instance, when video game developer EA Sports fused their video ads with live NFL data, they were able to deliver display ads with different combinations of copy, images, and backgrounds on the fly across sports mobile sites and apps. EA Sports also ensured high fan interaction with GIF highlights of their favorite teams through custom affinity targeting.

<strong>Steal the Show with Social</strong>.
In 2015, 50% of Super Bowl ads promoted hashtags, and this number is only expected to increase as Twitter partners with the NFL in 2016 to live-stream games throughout the season. But getting the most mileage out of a social campaign requires thoughtful groundwork before kickoff.

Brands who pre-promote their ads through social media contests and events can drive future value by placing tags to retarget users who visited their landing pages with specialty ads during the live event. Taking a page from this playbook, Budweiser enlisted the help of their social media following prior to the 2015 Super Bowl with a #BestBuds sweeps contest. More than just registering strong results for emotional effect, the #BestBuds campaign drove content, engagement, and conversation before the big commercial reveal. What’s more, the company dove into display, creating commercial-related landing pages that were tagged with tracking pixels for retargeting post-event and purchasing numerous display spots on prominent sports websites during the Super Bowl.

<strong>
Go Deep with Advanced Geotargeting</strong>.
Since most fans cheer for their hometown team, advanced programmatic <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/proximity-marketing-need-know/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">geotargeting</a> can be especially useful for large campaigns with dynamic creative. Utilizing ads that feature the local team creates an opportunity for your brand to become hyper-relevant in the eyes of the consumer. With programmatic geotargeting, brands can combine audience data filters with location signals to deliver customized ads that resonate with individuals.

Last year, Toyota’s “Let’s Go Places” commercials took a unique turn with geotargeted banner and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/snapchat-an-overview-and-ad-opportunities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Snapchat ads</a>. Video ads successfully ran inside Snapchat’s localized Live Story feature targeting the Los Angeles area, and banner ads ran in 15,000 U.S. cities incorporating city-specific information in the ads themselves.

In the end, no matter how memorable a television commercial may have been, it needs a digital component in order to survive in today’s complex marketing world. That’s why as the conversion funnel gets more complicated, game-day advertising strategy must begin long before the first Sunday night matchup and continue well after the Super Bowl confetti is cleaned up.

This was my third trip to dmexco, which is held every September in Cologne, Germany, and the second year in a row that our COO, Jay Friedman, went with me. Jay willingly crossing the Atlantic is curious enough, but to do so for a conference in a place that is as aesthetically pleasing as Akron—Cologne is no Florence or London—might seem strange since all our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/clients/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">clients</a> are in North America. So I thought I’d share the reasons why we make the trip each year:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>It’s a real trade show</strong>. The closest comparison in the states would be Ad Tech. But that show has featured the companies in the underbelly of digital marketing for years and could fit in one aisle of dmexco (there are about 25 aisles, if you were wondering).</li>
 	<li><strong>Speaking of size, it's enormous</strong>. Every ad and marketing tech company has a booth. The conference spans four conference halls that are each the size of an airline hangar. There are a number of two-story booths that reportedly cost over $100K Euros. My Fitbit logged over 28K steps during the two days of the conference, which helps offset the traditional meals of Cologne—sausages, schnitzel, and mashed potatoes.</li>
 	<li><strong>Unexpected, random, but meaningful conversations</strong>. While there are sales reps manning the booths, they mostly represent the European market. But it isn't uncommon to find senior sales and product executives in the booth, too. These encounters, when relevant to us, almost always result in a spontaneous and provocative conversation. Jay and I walk away from the booth knowing more or thinking differently about a channel or strategy than we did before.</li>
 	<li><strong>Senior and C-level attendance</strong>. We have meetings booked ahead of time with senior or C-level executives. This makes attendance cost-effective. Otherwise, it could take several different trips to NYC or other cities to meet with many decision-makers. Here, we can do it in under 48 hours.</li>
 	<li><strong>The knowledge we can gather in such a short period of time is unsurpassed</strong>. Enough conversations take place that it enables us to stitch together our thoughts and shift our thinking about a strategy one way or another. Whatever it is, it's concrete and actionable. A couple months ago, Jay asked me what we were trying to accomplish this year at dmexco. At the time, I couldn’t give him a straight answer. I didn’t have half our meetings booked and knew that I wouldn’t, in some cases, until the day of the conference. I told him I had a loose idea of whom we should meet with, if they were attending. But, as I write this, I know we both got enough answers and crystallized our thoughts around some key initiatives we’re tackling on behalf of our clients.</li>
</ol>
By the time folks started filing out on Thursday evening to catch their trains or flights, our feet ache and our heads are swimming. But over the next several days, a cohesion of ideas occurs that will have a meaningful, positive impact on Goodway’s business and our clients. It could be adjusting our bidding strategy, testing a new data partner, or discovering unexpected insights about the direction of a social platform we’re considering—whatever it is, this is information we didn't have last week, and it positively offsets the expense, the travel, the cuisine, and the aching feet.<i> </i>

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/five-reasons-attending-german-trade-show-benefits-clients/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Last week</a>, I wrote about why Goodway Group attends the <a href=""https://dmexco.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Digital Marketing Exposition &amp; Conference (dmexco)</a>. This week, I want to share a few observations from the 2016 event.

<img class=""alignright wp-image-3648 size-medium"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Getty-Images-Biz-Gears-Light-Bulb-300x191.jpg"" alt=""Idea Concept with Gears"" width=""300"" height=""191"" />

<strong>The growth paradox at dmexco</strong>. There were 50,000+ attendees this year—the most since the conference started. As this was my third year attending, I can share that while the addition of a fourth hall definitely reduced congestion, I didn't feel  those additional attendees represented ""new blood"" in the programmatic and ad tech industry. The cost of a booth is a sunk cost, and it could be that many U.S. companies don't feel the benefit justifies the expense. There weren't new ad or marketing technology companies there creating a buzz. It seemed that companies came there to entertain their UK and European clients. <em>Caveat: This observation is for U.S.-based companies only</em>.

<strong>""I pity the fool,"" Mr. T's famous catchphrase, comes to mind when I think about data companies setting up shop or competing in Europe</strong>. The United States is at an advantage for building a business around aggregating and selling behavioral or <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">geotargeting</a> data because we have a fairly uniform ability to collect signals (cookies, device IDs, or IP addresses) to use for targeting consumers. Imagine how difficult it would be if each state had their own online privacy policy around data collection, targeting, and identity usage. That's the reality of Europe. Each country has its own guidelines, and some, such as France, are way more restrictive than others. This presents the obvious challenges in identification accuracy and scale for companies looking to expand their market to Europe.

<strong>There's an arms race occurring between vendors offering header tag implementation for publishers, and some leaders are emerging</strong>. I feel fortunate Goodway Group recognized this movement as early as we did. We've been monitoring adoption for over a year now. While header bidding gained popularity with publishers quicker than we anticipated, we've been proactively educating our operational and sales teams on the adjustment to the auction process, pricing dynamics, and alternative ways to access quality inventory.

<strong>For a long time, the concept of ""remnant inventory"" was synonymously used for inventory available programmatically or via real-time bidding (RTB). That time is in the rearview mirror</strong>. Programmatic is now more closely associated with automated work flow and data strategy activation. This speaks to the maturation of our industry and the advancements that have occurred in processing power, system architecture, and CRM audience segmentation. The level of sophistication in conversations we're having with partners and vendors has increased year over year. The feedback we get in these conversations reinforces our convictions around our bidding strategy and inventory procurement. We know we are addressing the changing market dynamics in a sensible way.

Likewise, all the conversations at dmexco had a unique undercurrent. Think about the decisions happening at ""bid"" time: audience identification and valuation, fraud detection, pricing dynamics, and other factors all happening in thousandths of a second. This is the new reality for the buy side. I left dmexco feeling very confident the strategy we've been formulating is sound and puts us in the best position to find our clients' audiences.

Too soon to build your holiday wish list? Not according to over 35% of Americans who will start their holiday shopping before the end of this month, according to a <a href=""https://bestblackfriday.com/blog/holiday-shopping-season-2016-survey-and-analysis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">new survey by BlackFriday.com</a>, which is why many advertisers are already in holiday mode, building campaigns for the busiest selling season of the year. For those looking to take advantage of efficiencies in programmatic advertising to incentivize holiday shoppers, it’s not too late to build the perfect digital marketing mix for every potential consumer on your list.

Not sure which tactics should be on your nice list and which will give you nothing more than a lump of coal? We’ve got you covered. Check out these three tactics to unwrap a high performance programmatic ad strategy this holiday season.

<strong>Make mobile your new holiday tradition</strong>.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mobile penetration</a> isn’t just changing communication habits; it’s evolving consumer holiday shopping behavior. Whether they are looking for great gift ideas or checking if the hottest toy is on their local shelves, shoppers will use their smartphones for more than just directions to the store this season.

With total holiday sales expected to be over <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Holiday-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales-Will-Grow-17-this-Year/1014529"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">$884.50 billion in 2016</a>, it’s more important than ever for retailers to reach consumers while they research holiday gifts. According to a <a href=""https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/shop-til-they-drop-or-at-least-until-their-thumbs-hurt-getting-to-know-mobile-shoppers.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Nielsen study</a>, 72% of consumers used a mobile device to narrow down the options, and 60% used their smartphone to check local inventory. Once they’re in the door, a staggering 82% of consumers continued to use their smartphones in store to help them make purchase decisions, according to research from Google. And when they do buy online, more than <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">39% of shoppers</a> will look to their smartphone to make the purchase during the holiday season.

<em>Quick Tip: Make sure your creative is mobile-ready in the top 3 on-the-go ad sizes: 320×50, 300×250, and 728×90</em>.

<strong>Go home for the holidays, with hyperlocal ads</strong>.

During the holiday shopping season, many of us become creatures of convenience, visiting the stores we’re closest to in order to avoid crowded parking lots and long checkout lines. Smart advertisers use proximity to their advantage, targeting consumers when they are close to their store’s location.

Since <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/how-digital-connects-shoppers-to-local-stores.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">85% of consumers</a> say they’d be more likely to shop in stores that provide coupons and special deals personalized just to them, advanced programmatic <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/proximity-marketing-need-know/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">geotargeting</a> can be especially useful for holiday campaigns with dynamic creative. Serving in-store promotions or product-specific ads to consumers within the perimeter of their store locations, advertisers can target those most likely to interact. With programmatic geotargeting, marketers can combine audience data filters and contextual layering with location signals to deliver hyper-relevant ads that resonate with individuals.

<em>Quick Tip: Large retailers with <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">beacons</a> in place can communicate relevant value-added services with shoppers during crucial in-store moments<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Calibri;"">—</span></span></span>for instance, sharing the location of free gift-wrapping stations to those near a checkout lane</em>.

CPMs for display inventory typically rise during the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday and in the last days leading up to Christmas. And in 2015, Thanksgiving was the highest ranked among digital shopping days.

Ensuring campaign delivery during these high-cost weeks means proactively pacing your spend and continually optimizing your bids to overcome the imbalance between supply and demand.

Zig when others zag. Don’t forget to also minimize buying during prime price spikes for ongoing campaigns that are not holiday-specific. Ramp those campaigns back up after Christmas when CPMs drop to capitalize on performance.

Be sure to save campaign budget to target these eleventh-hour customers with hyper-relevant promotions, like free expedited shipping upgrades</em>.",Not sure which tactics should be on your nice list and which will give you nothing more than a lump of coal?

3684,The Rise of Programmatic TV Explained in 5 Graphics,"TV advertising is big business! With over 100 million households accessing traditional paid TV subscriptions, it’s no surprise advertisers are willing to shell out upwards of $70 billion each year for ads. It’s also a fairly predictable process since the traditional TV buying and selling model hasn’t changed in decades—until now.

Programmatic TV is poised to transform the way TV is bought and sold. What exactly is <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-programmatic-advertising/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">programmatic TV</a>? Simply put, it is an automated process for buying TV ads combined with data-driven technology to target consumers at the individual household level.

Traditionally, TV ads are bought manually through upfronts, requiring emailed or faxed requests for proposals, insertion orders, and trafficking. Programmatic TV applies instantaneous efficiency models from digital advertising to TV ads served across devices, as well as linear TV ads served across over-the-top (OTT) boxes.

Beyond efficiencies for advertisers and media networks, programmatic TV has the potential to be a win for brands and their consumers. Advertisers will be able to target viewers with ads specifically tailored to their interests, cutting out the noise from universally friendly or irrelevant ads.

Here’s a quick look into what the programmatic TV marketplace looks like today and how it will rise in the years to come:
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Cord Cutting Is Accelerating</strong></h3>
<img class=""wp-image-3688 aligncenter"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Table-Pay-TV-Viewer-and-Nonviewer-Share-300x210.jpg"" alt=""table-pay-tv-viewer-and-nonviewer-share"" width=""350"" height=""244"" />

First, let’s set our minds to the right channel. According to a recent <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eMarketer</a> report, a growing number of U.S. households are cutting the cable TV cord. By 2018, one in five US households will not subscribe to cable or satellite TV, a jump of 5.7% over four years. That rate is expected to accelerate in the years to come as cable and satellite providers steadily lose customers to connected TV options, like Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube.
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A Marriage of Necessity</strong></h3>

(May 15, 2016)[/caption]

According to <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/news/television/why-big-digital-video-and-tv-networks-are-increasingly-becoming-production-partners-171440"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">AdWeek</a>, “The list of legacy media players making alliances with digital companies continues to grow. Disney put $400 million into Vice, NBCU invested $200 million into BuzzFeed and another $200 million into Vox Media, and Turner put $15 million into the tech site Mashable.” As more and more name-brand networks partner up with digital TV platforms in order to stay relevant to their viewers, they’ll be looking to take advantage of connected TV’s experience in programmatic advertising. Once networks hit efficiencies of scale within digital video buying, it won’t be long before the bean counters look to mirror the results within linear TV.
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Word on the Street Is Getting Louder</strong></h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3687"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Google-Search-Trend-Programmatic-TV-History.png"" alt=""google-search-trend-programmatic-tv-history"" width=""500"" height=""256"" />

Think it’s all just hype? Google currently features more than 118,000 search results for “programmatic tv.” More than just a passing fad, Google research shows an upward trend of search history since late 2012, and Google’s Keyword Planner shows a 9,900 percent change in average monthly searches since September 2012. Similar terms, such as connected TV and addressable TV, are showing parallel results.
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Ability to Accurately Measure Cross-Device</strong></h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3689"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chart-Online-TV-Devices.png"" alt=""chart-online-tv-devices"" width=""350"" height=""259"" />

With watchers spreading their TV time nearly evenly between traditional remote controls and the computer mouse, advertisers must be prepared to reach consumers on whatever device they are using. What’s more, those who are watching on their TV sets are likely multitasking, according to a new <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eMarketer</a> report. Well over half of U.S. Internet users multitask with smartphones or computers while watching TV.

As a result, advertisers will soon demand the ability to measure TV with the same effectiveness and accuracy that we do in other types of programmatic campaigns. Precision in cross-device video targeting, optimization, and viewability metrics will be critical to achieving programmatic penetration in the TV media market.
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Future Looks Bright</strong></h3>
<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3690"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Chart-US-Programmatic-TV-Ad-Spending-297x300.jpg"" alt=""chart-us-programmatic-tv-ad-spending"" width=""350"" height=""353"" />

Today’s programmatic media is way beyond banner ads. Yet, programmatic TV has been slow to take hold. Only one percent of TV ad spends in 2016 were purchased programmatically. While this seems low, consider this: Iit represents $710 million of a $71 billion industry, and programmatic TV spending is expected to grow to over $4 billion by 2019! Others go so far as to estimate that programmatic will represent 17% of TV budgets in just two years. Regardless, if either reports are even close to accurate, the future for programmatic TV looks bright.

It’s why Rocky, Rudy, and The Karate Kid are household names. It’s also why empowering our partners to get recognized for their exceptional work day-in and day-out is just one way Goodway helps regional agencies to create not just valuable campaign results but to build a competitive edge.

For most, rooting for the little guy is less about seeing the unexpected upset and more about cheering on the everyday heroes who just won’t quit. They are the scrappy, little-known fighters from the middle of nowhere who are willing work harder and smarter than their competitors to stay ahead.

In the ad tech business, the same philosophy applies. As a bootstrapped, independent programmatic partner to local and regional brand agencies, we have to outsmart competitors in order to secure the best inventory and talent on behalf of our clients. What we have is a deep understanding of what adds value to local market campaigns and an unbeatable resilience to see our partners succeed. What’s more, in our years of working with regional agency partners, we’ve seen them provide an unparalleled level of personal attention and shared commitment to advertisers and their campaigns year after year.

Still, it’s always exciting to watch the dark horse swoop in to steal the show, which is exactly what we did at <a href=""https://www.digitaltradingawards.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">The Drum's 2016 US Digital Trading Awards</a>.

The presidential debates are now over, and we’ve got less than three weeks to go before the election. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/digital-politics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Regardless of which side of the aisle you’re on</a>, everyone can agree that this has been the most interesting and unusual campaign in recent history. Goodway decided to take a look at how Clinton's and Trump’s presidential campaigns have played out in terms of paid digital media.

We used data from <a href=""https://www.pathmatics.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pathmatics</a>, a competitive analytics ad tech service. They use web-crawling technology to scan ads and provide data, such as estimated spends, how impressions are sold, and much more. We initially evaluated the campaigns over the past year. Clinton’s campaign spent approximately $24M during this time period, almost double the Trump campaign’s $13M. However, when we analyzed the data, $12.1M of the Trump campaign’s spend occurred in the past two months. We limited our data to this timeframe to be able to better compare the two campaigns head to head. During this time, the Trump campaign outspent the Clinton campaign by 3 to 1.

Pathmatics provides daily impression and spend levels, so we took this information and calculated an estimated average CPM. Clinton’s CPM of $8.64 is a bit higher than Trump’s at $6.79. We found the difference intriguing and took a deep dive into the data to try to figure it out. Clinton has spent 84% of her budget on site-direct buys, which often command higher CPMs than ad network or programmatic buys. Only 47% of her campaign’s impression share is going to direct buys, which indicates that this inventory is expensive.

Trump’s numbers are telling a different story. He’s spent 69% of his budget on direct buys, with 27% of the impressions going to direct. This also indicates that he is paying a high CPM for these impressions. However, Trump has a 65% impression share going to ad networks, with only 28% of his budget spent on ad networks, indicating a low CPM. There could be many reasons why Trump has far more impressions in ad networks than site-direct buys, but a good guess is that the Clinton campaign booked direct buys in advance, and Trump placed his buys far more recently, when perhaps less direct inventory was available.

We also took a look at the top sites by overall spend. Clinton’s top adverting sites from the past two months are nytimes.com and politico.com. It looks like Clinton has been playing to her liberal base and also trying to reach out to a politically savvy audience. Trump on the other hand is favoring more mainstream media with his top two sites, aol.com and youtube.com. It seems like Trump’s strategy is to try to reach the general population.

Finally, the last stat we evaluated was programmatic buying. Only 1% of Trump’s budget went to DSPs, and Clinton didn’t spend any money on DSPs. Given that <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-programmatic-advertising/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">programmatic</a> is now the dominant method of buying display media, we hope the next presidential election cycle shows a higher percentage of DSP buying.

3768,Back to Basics: Programmatic Is More Efficient,"<em>Contributed by <strong>Amanda Benoist, Marketing Content Strategist at Goodway Group</strong></em>

It used to be easy to follow a consumer’s buying process. They saw an advertisement. They went to a store and talked to a human being about the product. They decided to buy the product or not.

The fact that the digital landscape has changed everything in the way that we buy isn’t debatable. The Internet has made the process much more complicated with a million micro-moments that can be the difference between a new customer and a missed opportunity. The question is, has your media strategy kept up to date?

In this ""Back to the Basics"" blog series, I’ll help you understand the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-programmatic-advertising/"" target=""_blank"">basics of programmatic advertising</a> and share several reasons why you should redefine your media strategy with programmatic. Today’s topic? Why programmatic buying is more efficient than traditional ad buys.

Simply put, programmatic lowers the time investment for your media buyer. Traditional ad buying requires calling a lot of different publishers manually, negotiating a rate and signing an IO, running separate formats to see what works best for your audience, and trafficking multiple tags. Programmatic allows you to streamline all of that into a single platform, increasing the speed and efficiency of finding and optimizing toward your audience. You simply can’t do all this with one media buyer anymore, and if you try, you are going to get left behind.

You might be thinking, <em>It’s only more efficient because it’s all remnant inventory that no one else wants</em>. The reality is the origins of programmatic advertising were based in real-time bidding, which often allowed publishers the opportunity to sell ad space that was left over after selling directly, but this is no longer the case.

All types of inventory are available programmatically, including premium sites. Today’s programmatic is much more than just banner ads and basic real-time bidding. There’s the foundation of programmatic services<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">–</span></span>like <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/capabilities/programmatic-media/"" target=""_blank"">display, mobile, and video</a><span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">–</span></span>and then there’s media that goes well beyond and strengthens your agency. It’s no longer unheard of to buy a site like the<em> New Yorker</em> or  the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> programmatically, as well as pre-roll on Twitter and hyperlocal mobile inventory.

When you aren’t dealing with each publisher individually or even each network, you can focus on audience strategy and optimization. With programmatic, you can reach inventory on millions of quality sites with millions of high-impact users, expanding your audience diversity beyond what can be achieved by manually going to a limited number of publishers. It’s a one-stop shop to access global inventories across display, mobile, and TV, but more to come on the benefits of <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/"" target=""_blank"">cross-device advertising</a> in our next ""Back to the Basics"" blog post.

Pumpkin-spice lattes are back on the menu and the only new movies out are horror flicks. Halloween must be close!

As you prepare your digital campaigns for the holiday season, you're likely considering new ways to dress up your ads with spooky filters and scary-good offers. After all, the National Retail Federation reports that more Americans will splurge on costumes, candy and pumpkins than ever before, for a record <a href=""https://nrf.com/media/press-releases/halloween-spending-reach-record-91-billion"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">9.1 billion in Halloween spending</a> this year.

To help you scare up new customers, we're sharing four digital strategies to boo-st seasonal sales this Halloween:
<h4><strong>Forecasting a Bountiful Campaign with Weather-Based Signals</strong></h4>
Signal-based strategies are perfect for building ads with small variations across disparate DMAs. For example, a national coffee shop might use weather signals — it’s chilly, raining and after sunset — to send an ad for hot cocoa to consumers in those areas. Whereas, a nearly identical ad promoting the new ""monster"" slushie could be served to customers in warmer locales. Savvy marketers will take the ad one step further with a countdown timer to create a sense of urgency to try out seasonal products before they are gone.
<h4><strong>Echo Remarketing Is Practically Magic</strong></h4>
Do you ever get the feeling that a product is stalking you online? This Halloween, those specialty cupcakes just might be. Standard pixels are great for retargeting general or brand awareness ads to users. But with new echo remarketing tactics, advertisers can personalize their creative even further based on a user's actions on their site. When echo remarketing is activated, the pixel collects things like when a user customizes a cupcake flavor, icing color or decoration. Then it remembers those selections to retarget the user with an ad featuring that exact cupcake. Scary cool, huh?
<h4><strong>Goblins, Ghouls and Geos  ... Oh My!</strong></h4>
Trick-or-treating on an empty stomach? Now that's scary! With advanced geotargeting, you can set up a geofence to target parents browsing on their phones within a few blocks of your store. Then, use an address-based map takeover to entice them to stop in to your nearest location for a healthier snack and save the candy for later.
<h4><strong>There's No Hiding from People-Based Marketing</strong></h4>
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-people-based-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">New people-based marketing techniques</a> mean advertisers can match their first-party customer data, like who added that Frankenstein costume to their wish list, to specific customers' phones and tablets. When you know who your on-the-go customers are, you can retarget them with more relevant mobile offers featuring deals they're most interested in, like easy one-click ordering. Also, remember to use exclusion segments to ensure customers who already bought don't see ads that they don't need.

There is a lot of potential to boost seasonal sales this Halloween, or apply these strategies to other holiday campaigns throughout the year. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/contact-us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Reach out to us to learn more</a>.

Many companies develop a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/fall-forecast-holiday-programmatic-spending/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">holiday advertising strategy</a> for Q4, but for some advertisers, it’s a time to figure out how to best spend their remaining budgets. Before the hustle and bustle of the holiday season gets into full swing, we’d like to share some quick programmatic media strategies for those looking to maximize their Q4 budgets this year:
<h3>Last-Minute Spending</h3>
At large organizations, the marketing department often receives a fixed budget for the year. If the entire budget isn’t spent in the calendar year, the department may not get as robust of a budget next year. So many marketing managers will look to blow through their remaining budget in the last month or even last two weeks of the year to ensure they receive similar funds in the next year. These types of advertisers can still spend their money strategically, even though they are trying to spend as quickly as they can.

We recommend these clients start with video ads for two reasons: First, it’s a visual medium that is perfect for branding, awareness and reaching consumers at the top of the funnel. Secondly, programmatic video inventory is typically more expensive than display or mobile takeovers, so if you need to spend marketing dollars quickly, video will help you achieve that. Depending on how much budget a client has to spend, we often recommend combining programmatic video with mobile and display tactics to catch those users later in the funnel and reach them again with remarketing.
<h3>Heavy Up Budgets</h3>
Sometimes, we hear from clients in Q4 who tell us they have extra money in their advertising budget that they aren't sure how to spend. In these cases, when a client is looking to heavy up on their existing media, we recommend adding mobile tactics to their campaigns because there is so much opportunity in this growing space. Our forecasting shows that impression levels across mobile web, in-app and mobile video are outpacing display impressions. Adding mobile to a display plan will increase brand awareness and conversions. Advertisers will also see a clearer picture for attribution since most consumers use several devices for research when considering a purchase. Additionally, if the advertiser is in any retail category, they can layer in advanced strategies, such as mobile couponing, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">beacon technology</a>, and hyper-local <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/dressing-up-your-creative/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">geofencing</a> for an additional boost in conversions.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Advanced TV</a> is another great tactic to consider for a heavy up campaign because you can use it to extend a digital video or TV campaign. If you're already running digital video, you'll add premium non-skippable inventory to your buy that uses the same reporting and metrics as your current buy. If you're extending a TV campaign, you can expand your reach by targeting both your traditional TV audience who also watches streaming content and cord-cutters who might not have seen your ad in the first place.
<h3>Always-On Campaigns</h3>
Finally, at this time of year we also hear from clients who are always-on advertisers, such as a CPG brand. They may consider pausing their campaigns to avoid competing with holiday spenders but sometimes decide instead to stay top of mind with awareness campaigns throughout the holiday season.

For these types of clients, we recommend refining targeting so the campaign is focused on the best-performing audiences. There are a couple ways to do this: The first method is to look through reporting and focus the budget solely on the geos, dayparts or third-party audience segments that are the best converters. Another strategy is to center advertising on Private Marketplace (PMP) deals. These deals allow advertisers to home in on the specific sites that are performing best or that are most relevant to their customers. You get all of the benefits of buying programmatically but advertise only to a highly targeted audience.

No matter what type of client you are or what type of budget you have to spend, Goodway Group can help you <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/capabilities/programmatic-media/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">maximize your Q4 budget</a>.

The principles surrounding digital media—determining your campaign objective, identifying your target, communicating your message, and measuring your results—are no different than any ad campaign that ran one hundred years ago. Marketers still need to maximize their productivity without sacrificing quality, leverage their data to target the right customers, and measure campaign analytics to deliver real ROI results.

Programmatic is just new in the terms that are now associated with this medium. So in this week’s ""Back to the Basics"" post, I’ll share how programmatic can help you know what’s working and what’s not.

We are a generation on the move. Tapping into technology’s ability to achieve insights across multiple devices is the key to capitalizing on consumer behavior. Programmatic provides the opportunity to not just advertise across all devices, but to track the same user on every device. This kind of unified advertising reinforces your message and makes sure that your ads are not lost in the noise online.

Because you can measure user impact across devices, you can capture your campaign’s impact throughout the full conversion funnel and evaluate your media investment against <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goodway-group-debuts-validate360/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">real world business results</a>—in-store foot traffic, online and offline purchases, and brand lift. With programmatic, every campaign element builds insights about what drives a certain kind of consumer behavior, what message works best, or which ad format gains the most attention.

Likewise, you can bring in your own data to target your existing customers. CRM data can be matched to DSP data to be able to advertise to an audience that you’ve built over time. You can also pixel your website and target visitors that have performed specific actions, like those who have browsed through product listings or researched your hours and locations.

This big data can be taken offline for efficiencies as well. If the data shows consumer interest in a particular product, you can dovetail your inventory production. If you know a consumer already made the purchase, you can skip out on wasted impressions in a retargeting campaign. The possibilities are endless.

With programmatic campaigns, you can gather loads of big data each day from every bid opportunity, each impression bought, and each conversion in real time. This makes it even easier than traditional advertising to set a clear and measurable goal, and to optimize the campaign toward that goal while the campaign is running.

We take advantage of the opportunity to invest in up-to-date research, experiment with new technologies or processes, and respond to the client needs of tomorrow faster. Our truly collaborative business model fosters innovation and entrepreneurship to get the best results possible for our clients’ campaigns.

<strong>Being Selective Means We Make the Right Choices for the Right Reasons</strong>

As an independent company, we have the freedom to choose the clients we work with. While many competitors often focus solely on revenue potential, we care and have the autonomy to take calculated risks to partner with smaller regional clients that demonstrate similar passion, values, and principles as our own, or pass on those who don’t. It also means we can afford to do the right thing for our clients no matter what, without pressure from shareholders or stock analysts.

<strong>Being Mindful of Our Culture Means We Attract the Right Talent</strong>

The most important asset we have is our people. They are the real soul of Goodway Group and the visible demonstration of our company culture. That culture centers around personal integrity, accountability, and a “roll up your sleeves” work ethic. Our independence has allowed us to define this culture and grow our teams on our own terms, where the net result is hiring only the best talent who embody the bold, solutions-oriented vision of our organization.

No matter which side of the aisle you are voting for in today’s election, remember that our freedom to choose is the cornerstone of how we should live and work.","This Election Day, we at Goodway Group are reminded why being a fiercely independent force in the world is a positive thing.",11/7/16 19:55,post,https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/a-vote-for-the-independent-partner/,https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-independent-freedom-300x199.jpg,GettyImages-independent-freedom-300x199.jpg,/nas/content/live/prodgoodway/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-independent-freedom-300x199.jpg,11033,GettyImages-independent-freedom-300x199,,,,https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-independent-freedom-300x199.jpg,Goodway News,independent partner,"Because Goodway Group is a privately owned independent company, we can quickly make decisions and nimbly adapt to the changing programmatic ad tech scene.",,,15,Goodway Group,info@goodwaygroup.com,,,a-vote-for-the-independent-partner,,

Today’s consumers will consult more than <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/five-holiday-shopping-trends-marketers-should-watch.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">12 sources</a> before making a big purchase and nearly <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Users-Seek-Truth-Online-Reviews/1009656"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">75 percent of customers</a> will read online reviews before buying.

Sure, with your direct buy or ad network you get a reliable circulation or audience view, but do you really know who is seeing your ads? How do you know you aren’t paying for the wrong consumer on the right site or the right consumer in the wrong context? That’s the challenge with buying impressions rather than buying a consumer. Let’s take a look at the benefits of more sophisticated targeting in today’s ""Back to the Basics"" insight:

More than a one-size-fits-all solution, programmatic serves up data to give you a real-time pulse on where, when, and who to target. Traditional segment-based buying filters audiences based on five to ten attributes like age, gender, income, etc. In contrast, programmatic buying enables you to evaluate based on millions of data features in real time. Targeting becomes incredibly sophisticated and precise, which means you can see with a high degree of detail exactly who your audience is and scale campaigns up to a very large volume.

For example, if you’re selling cars, you can buy an in-market auto shopper audience to target those most likely to make a purchase. If you sell organic baby food, you can buy the intersection of a moms-with-young-children audience and a preference-for-organic-food audience. Being able to target so precisely increases the efficiency of your media buys.

Thanks to programmatic buying, advertising messages get to the right person, at the right time, in the right place. If you truly care about helping customers explore, dream, and find what they are looking for, programmatic can get you there.

3861,Your Holiday Guide to e-Newsletter Advertising,"<em>Contributed by <strong>Jonathan Pinkerton, Media Product Manager at Goodway Group</strong></em>

<img class=""size-full wp-image-3901 aligncenter"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/e-Newsletter_Blog_201611-1.jpg"" alt=""e-newsletter_blog_201611"" width=""1000"" height=""431"" />

From Apple Watches to peppermint mochas to cozy sweaters on sale for $19.99, my in-box has reminded me that it’s time to break out the balsam fir candle and start planning for the holidays.

This time of year, especially, I receive dozens of emails every day from companies promoting their newest product or suggesting how I can be the best gift-giver this December. But I also receive coveted emails with the latest news headlines, old photos from my father that make great <a href=""https://twitter.com/goodwaygroup/status/784020296692928512"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">#throwbackthursday</a> tweets, and exciting travel deals.

My in-box is uniquely Jonathan Pinkerton and your inbox is uniquely you.

No two email in-boxes are the same, as they are incredibly personal to the user. Yet despite advances in technology over the past decade, the user experience has pretty much stayed the same across the board. You click, open, read, take a sip from your eggnog latte, file, and move on to the next message.

Whether you’re reading on your smartphone while waiting to check out at the store or sitting at your computer taking a quick break from writing your next blog post, email is something people engage with almost daily. That’s why e-newsletters offer such an effective advertising platform to engage with users<span style=""margin: 0px; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">—</span></span>we know they have to open the message to get what they are looking for, and, once they do, your ad can grab their attention and their focus.

As a marketer, getting in front of a captive audience is half the battle, and e-newsletter ads actually make achieving a high conversion rate easier due to the high level of user focus involved. One in four users who see an ad in an email takes an action, making it one of the highest converting methods of delivery according to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eMarketer</a>. Email also has a 122% return on investment, more than four times the ROI for social media, direct mail, search, and display, also according to eMarketer:

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3904 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/e-Newsletters_Blog_Chart_1_201611.png"" alt=""e-newsletters_blog_chart_1_201611"" width=""324"" height=""192"" />

Not only do e-newsletters offer huge audience potential today, their audience continues to grow each year. In the United States, there are more than 240 million users who have an active email address, and that number is expected to grow nearly 3 percent next year to 247 million:

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-3905 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/e-Newsletters_Blog_Chart_2_201611.png"" alt=""e-newsletters_blog_chart_2_201611"" width=""324"" height=""148"" />

It’s one thing to have the audience’s attention, but you wouldn’t advertise diapers with cute snowflakes to someone reading an e-newsletter from a jewelry store who is contemplating a surprise engagement over the holidays. Honing your message and targeting it to the right readers are equally important. Luckily, we can programmatically buy ads in more than 2,500 newsletter subscriptions broken down into more than 20 different categories to find your ideal customer.

So if you’re looking to promote your warm beachfront property hotel in Orbitz’s or Priceline’s deal-saver emails or push your must-have electronic toy in CNET’s weekly-reader blast, we can do just that. For those worried about wasting dollars on emails that go to spam boxes or through cleaning services like Unroll.Me, your ads are only served once the email is opened, making e-newsletter advertising a highly viewable tactic.

As you plan out your holiday programmatic spend, e-newsletter advertising is a great way to ensure your campaign doesn’t get Grinched. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/contact-us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Contact us</a> to learn more about how you can get started today.

You’re not alone—over 67% of CMOs do not totally understand programmatic or how to apply it to their marketing campaigns.* Yet, <a href=""https://www.dnb.com/perspectives/marketing-sales/is-programmatic-advertising-the-future-of-marketing.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dun &amp; Bradstreet</a> interviewed 100 marketers and found, “78 percent planned to spend up to half of their advertising budgets on programmatic this year. What's more, 65 percent said they would spend more on programmatic this year than ever before.”

If you’re not yet buying programmatic media, now is the time learn about this buying method and some of the advantages that it can offer. For our final post in the ""Back to the Basics"" series, we’ll put your fears to ease and focus on the outlook for programmatic in the years to come.

The potential for brands investing in programmatic is enormous. In 2016, U.S. programmatic digital display ad spending will reach <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-Than-Two-Thirds-of-US-Digital-Display-Ad-Spending-Programmatic/1013789"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">$22.10 billion</a>, according to eMarketer. That’s a jump of 39.7% over last year and represents 67.0% of total digital display ad spending in the United States. Mobile programmatic display spending is set to increase as well to 59.6%, reaching $15.45 billion in 2016, and digital video isn’t too far behind at $5.51 billion.

Programmatic is closing in on larger and larger portions of the overall advertising market. Thanks to efficiencies in programmatic targeting, cost, and delivery, it’s safe to say that the future of programmatic advertising is bright.

So what do you do when your marketing needs outgrow traditional media? You redefine. Influencing today’s consumers isn’t about just a single touch. It’s a series of touch points over time—in both traditional and digital media—that add up to something really powerful. Programmatic isn’t going away, so make sure your strategy will continue to build brand loyalty and sentiment in the years to come.

Goodway has redefined what it means to be strategic through programmatic media. For us, it’s about embracing new marketing tools early, then helping our clients understand and utilize those tools to get results that won’t break the bank or their backs. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/contact-us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Contact us</a> today and start to redefine your expectations of what programmatic can offer.

On Gratitude: What We're Thankful for

For most of us, Thanksgiving is a time for family, football, turkey-induced naps and black Friday shopping. But what’s really at the foundation of this holiday, year after year? Gratitude.

At Goodway Group, we have a lot to be grateful for. Over the years, we’ve built a team culture committed to giving our agency and brand partners honestly smart digital advice. Not only has this strategy created award-winning campaigns, it’s allowed us to work and partner with some awesome marketers throughout the country.

Still, it’s always exciting to get outside recognition of what we do so well, which is exactly what happened in 2017. Goodway Group was named a SHRM When Work Works award winner in May, one of Fortune’s top 15 Best Workplaces for Women in September, and the 8th Best Workplace on Fortune’s medium-sized business list in October.

We’re thrilled to receive these awards, but we owe all the credit to our employees, who provide meaning in our work and who helped us become a trusted guide to so many media planners, CMOs and agencies. A special thank-you goes out to each of them for their dedication and teamwork.

Most of all, we’re thankful for our amazing partners this year. There are far too many to list here, but we wanted to share our heartfelt appreciation with each of you. None of this would have been possible without your continued support and your trust in us to build programmatic campaigns that help drive the revenue engine of your business. Thank you for choosing us.

To all our friends and partners, we’re sending the warmest thoughts and best wishes for a Thanksgiving season filled with joy!

4044,Driving Retail Foot Traffic This Holiday Season,"<img class=""alignright wp-image-4054 size-medium"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock_retail-foot-traffic-300x138.jpg"" alt=""istock_retail-foot-traffic"" width=""300"" height=""138"" />It’s no surprise to retailers that <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/fall-forecast-holiday-programmatic-spending/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">online holiday sales are expected to continue to rise in 2016</a>, with some estimating that ecommerce holiday sales will make up almost 25% of total retail ecommerce sales for 2016. However, savvy retailers know this increase in online traffic will also spell increased foot traffic, especially during the holidays.

For brick-and-mortar retailers, online advertising can be an exciting avenue to pursue new customers and to encourage repeat visits. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/capabilities/programmatic-media/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Programmatic advertising</a> from Goodway Group can help connect the dots between a consumer’s cyber footprint and your store’s foot traffic with three easy tactics:

<strong>1.  Match offline data stored in a CRM system, loyalty program, or email-marketing platform to target customers online.</strong>

By establishing the right data connections and algorithms, we can match consumer data to cookie IDs <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">across devices</a> to target users with digital ads based on their past purchases, browsing history, and more. Don’t worry; our technology preserves the integrity of all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by using an algorithmic hash process that protects users’ anonymity.

<strong>2. Provide relevant, localized information to drive shoppers in-store and improve the customer experience.</strong>

Consumers are online more than ever before, but ecommerce still only represents <a href=""https://ycharts.com/indicators/ecommerce_sales_as_percent_retail_sales"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">8.1% of total U.S. retail sales</a> as of June 2016. Retailers can retarget digital users who searched relevant terms previously, allowing the retailer to share product in-store availability to consumers looking for a similar product through seamless native content integrations. Then using <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">beacons</a>, complementary mobile coupons can be served in-app when that shopper is nearby to increase the likelihood that he or she will walk into the store and make the buy, or assist those in the store contemplating what purchase to make. A recent Google study showed <a href=""https://marketingland.com/consumers-spoken-2016-year-webrooming-180125"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">82 percent</a> of shoppers consult their phones in-store about a purchase they’re about to make.

<strong>3. Leverage multiple ad tactics and optimize continuously to achieve better results with greater efficiency.</strong>

Your store may be a one stop shop, but your digital ad programs shouldn’t be. Give special consideration to how you target consumers across all of their devices<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">—</span></span>desktops, mobile phones, and tablets<span style=""margin: 0px; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">—</span></span>and be sure to leverage a variety of targeting tactics, such as behavioral targeting, predictive modeling, contextual targeting, and retargeting. Also, consider day-parting your campaigns to place ads during the optimal times of day that will encourage foot traffic, like lunchtime and rush hour, to deliver quick and efficient results.

And don’t forget that the lines between shopping via ecommerce and in-store are blurring. Many people are literally doing both simultaneously by engaging in webrooming (researching items online then purchasing them in-store) and showrooming (browsing items in a store and purchasing them online later) behaviors throughout their shopping process. According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eMarketer</a>, 85% of Internet users plan to webroom during the holiday season in 2016. Top products that users webroom include appliances, electronics, men’s apparel, toys and games, and kitchen items. Engaging them on both their desktop and mobile devices is critical to making your holiday revenue dreams come true!

Black Friday is the most important day of the year for retailers and manufacturers. According to <a href=""https://news.adobe.com/press-release/marketing-cloud/media-alert-adobe-data-shows-black-friday-breaks-online-sales-record-3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adobe Digital Insights</a>, shoppers spent a record-breaking $3.34 billion online on Black Friday this year. We were curious to see if the top-selling products as reported by Adobe were also the top advertised products, so we dove into <a href=""https://www.pathmatics.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pathmatics</a> data to find out. The results might surprise you.

<strong>Who were the Top Toy and Electronics Advertisers and Sellers? </strong>

The five best-selling toys this year were LEGO Creator sets, Razor electric scooters, Nerf guns, DJI Phantom drones, and the Barbie Dreamhouse. The top five electronic products were Apple iPads, Samsung 4K TVs, Apple MacBook Air, LG TVs, and Microsoft Xbox. We investigated the advertiser spend for these manufacturers in Pathmatics and compared them to the top advertisers during the two-week period leading up to and including Black Friday weekend.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4099 size-large"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/201612-10373-WEB-Black-Friday-Blog-Post-Graphic-2-806x1024.png"" alt=""201612-10373-web-black-friday-blog-post-graphic-2"" width=""806"" height=""1024"" />

Of all nine companies represented in the top ten best-selling items, only Microsoft appeared in Pathmatic’s top ten companies for digital advertising spend. Retailers such as Best Buy, Target, and Amazon also cracked the top ten in spend, but the rest of the advertisers spanned several categories from movies to makeup, including Merck, Gap, Procter &amp; Gamble, Hulu, Moana, and Revlon. The three major retailers in the top ten all advertised for a combination of Black Friday specials and specific products, which complicates determining the correlation between online advertisers and online sales. Thus, it is possible that some of the top sellers did receive an advertising boost from retailers.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4098 size-large"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/201612-10373-WEB-Black-Friday-Blog-Post-Graphic-1-845x1024.png"" alt=""201612-10373-web-black-friday-blog-post-graphic-1"" width=""845"" height=""1024"" />

<strong>How Much Did These Advertisers Spend?</strong>

The top-selling toy manufacturers spent surprisingly little in online advertising. Only LEGO Group made Pathmatics’ top 500 advertisers list, coming in at 210, with an estimated spend of $347,000. The other four manufacturers spent an estimated average of $34,000 during the Black Friday run-up. This might seem strange, but it makes sense given the <a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">FTC restrictions around advertising to children online</a>. Additionally, children 0-11, the age group most likely to play with toys, is not online as often as children and teens older than 12. According to eMarketer, 92% of children under 12 watch live or time-shifted TV, but only 26% access the Internet via a computer and 35% access the Internet via a multi-media device. To reach children, TV is still the dominant medium, although this is slowly changing. The <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a> research also shows that the U.S. games and toy industry spend is down overall from last year but that TV spending declined by 18% while digital spending only declined by 7.5%.

Three of the top four electronics advertisers spent an estimated six figures or more—$7,791,000 for Microsoft, $1,818,100 for Samsung, and $604,000 for LG. Samsung and LG were the 35th and 118th overall top-spending advertisers leading up to Thanksgiving. Unlike toy makers, electronics companies would want to promote their wares online— since they are selling products that consumers will use to access the Internet. However, Apple is a big outlier. They only spent an estimated $6,900 in digital advertising yet had two of the top-selling products this year. Apple is known for their outdoor and television advertising campaigns, which likely explains why they spent so little on digital advertising. It also has a devoted fan following, and the iPad and MacBook are perennially popular products. In contrast, Microsoft spent millions online to promote various products such as Office software, cloud computing, Xbox consoles, and laptops. Microsoft’s brand loyalty is not nearly as strong as Apple’s, hence the need to promote its products substantially with advertising.

<strong>Different Strategies for Different Industries</strong>

Goodway Group’s focus is on digital advertising, but a successful Black Friday advertising strategy should encompass all channels to reach consumers. Additionally, what works for one industry doesn’t necessarily work for another. The toy industry faces some obvious challenges with advertising online. However, there are opportunities for toy advertisers to start expanding their strategies. Contextual advertising is a great way to reach children online and stay within FTC rules, and advertisers can also target parents with a variety of tactics. The consumer electronics industry, on the other hand, is already advertising heavily online as part of its holiday shopping media mix, which we would recommend for any retail advertiser.

Unlike other awards, there was no self-nomination process; instead, it’s entirely based on feedback our employees have voluntarily and anonymously shared on Glassdoor. To determine the winners of the awards, Glassdoor evaluates all <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Goodway-Group-Reviews-E345398.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">company reviews</a> shared by our employees over the past year. This year, we are proud to be recognized as a Best Place to Work among companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, according to those based in the United States.

A huge thank-you goes out to all our employees who took the time to share their perspectives on what it’s like to work here. We appreciate all the valuable feedback as it only helps us to drive an even more positive culture.

Below are just a few words employees shared on Glassdoor that contributed toward the award and that made us feel incredibly honored to be recognized:

<em>“Ever since I started working for Goodway Group I have been overwhelmed with how incredible my co-workers are and how much management LISTENS to us. I have never worked for a company that relentlessly strives to make their employees feel valued. I finally feel like I've landed at a company that I never want to leave.”</em>

<em>“My teammates are some the sharpest tacks I’ve ever met, and it’s a thrill to work together because it always feels like a meeting of great minds.”</em>

<em>“This company is the true definition of family. The collaboration and sense of team that is displayed on a daily basis is truly remarkable.

<em>“I worked in corporate America for several years before finding my dream job at Goodway . . . . The company culture is incredible. The CEO and the management team really care about their employees (you don't find that very often anymore) . . . . If you are looking for a fast-paced, challenging career in Internet marketing, Goodway is for you.”</em>

<em>“Working from home full time might be what initially hooks you into taking a job at Goodway Group, but the people will be why you stay. Your co-workers are amazingly supportive, especially considering the fact that you don't have the physical presence in a cube or office down the hall. Leadership is transparent, approachable, and genuinely concerned about the happiness of their employees. And the workload is fair and balanced, with the usual ebbs and flows of an annual business cycle. I have found my forever company with Goodway Group, and I couldn't be more satisfied with my move here.”</em>

The holiday season is full of sound. Whether it’s prepping your annual dinner party playlist, listening to your favorite holiday songs during your commute, or slimming down for that New Year’s dress with your workout jams—music is in the air!

Now is your chance to help consumers hear your message by targeting the hundreds of millions of subscribers who listen to streaming playlists with programmatic audio. Keep reading to learn more about how programmatic audio is the gift that keeps on giving to your marketing mix.

<strong>Become Part of Their Traditions</strong>

With programmatic audio, you can be a part of their holiday traditions this season. Accompany them in the car ride to the holiday light display. Or provide the soundtrack to waiting for pictures with Santa at the mall. The opportunities are endless because music is one of the most emotional forms of individual expression and has the potential to enrich any moment or memory. This means you can tailor the perfect message for any moment in a user’s holiday routine and ensure it sticks.

Since consumers select their music playlists based on their mood, environment, or activities, marketers have a unique opportunity to connect with their target consumer in an extremely relevant way. Through the efficiency of programmatic, marketers can tap into the sea of first-party data, make powerful inferences about consumer habits, and match targeted 15- or 30-second ads to specific types of playlists, all within their existing media campaigns.

Here’s how playlist targeting works: Advertisers can select from a collection of music mixes, such as holiday party, romance, cookie baking, or New Year’s workout, to target specific listeners who are in the right state of mind to hear about their products. Want to learn more? Check out why advertisers are tuning into audio again <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advertisers-tuning-audio/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>.

<strong>Be Where It Matters</strong>

The promise of programmatic audio is that you can be where it matters to your consumers, wherever that is. Because streaming music has a supreme fluidity across devices and activities, marketers can follow their consumers through their daily journey.

Let’s pressure test this in the real world: A digital audio listener puts on his or her favorite playlist while getting ready to go over to a friend’s holiday party, continues listening on the drive over, and enjoys the party’s streaming playlist with everyone’s favorite holiday songs upon arrival.

This kind of fluidity and accompaniment is unmatched compared to other channels. According to a recent <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/us/brands/insights/music-streamers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Spotify study</a>, music listeners have selected playlists for listening everywhere from at home (85%), to in the car (63%), to at work/school (33%), to while shopping 15%, and beyond:

<img class=""wp-image-4193 size-full aligncenter"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Where-stream-the-most-e1482347248754.png"" alt=""Spotify infographic: where music listeners stream the most"" width=""600"" height=""634"" />

<strong>More Than Loyal Listeners</strong>

Consumer attention is at an all-time premium during the busy holiday season. Programmatic audio can help you cut through the noise and connect more effectively with your target audiences.

According to a <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/us/brands/insights/music-streamers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Spotify Brand Impact Study</a>, music streamers are more than just loyal listeners—they are loyal brand advocates, too. Because programmatic audio enables marketers to target consumers throughout their entire day and with content they find extremely relevant, streamers are twice as likely as non-streamers to advocate for and feel emotionally connected to brands. They are also 1.5 times more likely to have positive rational associations to ad brands.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4200"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Spotify-brand-advocates-e1482347355640.png"" alt=""Spotify infographic: music listeners are brand advocates"" width=""500"" height=""335"" />

<a href=""https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/IABDigitalAudioPSR11.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">IAB’s Platform Status Report for Digital Audio</a> goes one step further to show how adding digital audio to an ad campaign drives an array of positive consumer responses well beyond the click. For example, users who listened to one hour or more of online radio each week took action on a brand—visited an advertiser’s website, searched online for more info, purchased a product, followed a social site, etc.—more often than those who did not listen to any online radio.

<strong>Your Ultimate Wingman This Holiday Season</strong>

You know there are many elements that play a role in a user’s path to conversion. Now, you can track which ones are working and which aren’t across all channels, including audio. Because programmatic audio utilizes the same targeting tools from your video, mobile, and cross-device campaigns, reporting and attribution are more robust and streamlined. This is holiday music to marketers’ ears (pun intended).

According to a recent <a href=""https://pages.thetradedesk.com/Advertising-Week_AdAge-Audio-Whitepaper-Download-form.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">study from Ad Age and The Trade Desk</a>, the addition of programmatic audio to a traditional banner campaign can generate four times as many conversions. With full attribution capabilities, programmatic audio breaks the code on conversions to measure sales lift and provides advertisers with actionable insights they can apply throughout their entire marketing strategy. Think of programmatic audio as the ultimate wingman to your advertising campaign this holiday season.

Get the nod to be the hot date for everyone’s New Year’s Eve party this year.

Programmatic is changing advertising and has become the dominant way for digital advertisers to purchase media: According to eMarketer, 67% of display advertising, 69% of mobile advertising and 56% of digital video advertising were programmatic in 2016. But all of the tech talk around algorithms and data science has left some a bit confused about how it all comes together. In fact, over 67%* of CMOs do not entirely understand programmatic or how to apply it to their marketing campaigns. You might be asking yourself what’s the difference between a DSP and an ad network and how both are different from an ad exchange. We’re here to help define these terms and highlight the pros and cons of each method of buying digital media.
<h2>Defining Digital Media Buying and Selling</h2>
<ul type=""disc"">
 	<li style=""padding-top: 10px;""><strong>Programmatic</strong>: Buying digital media in an automated fashion, usually through an exchange or a demand-side platform.</li>
 	<li style=""padding-top: 10px;""><strong>Ad Network</strong>: A media company that sells inventory across a range of publisher sites to advertisers at a set price. Ad networks work directly with publishers to sell ad impressions that a publisher has not directly sold. It is not programmatic.</li>
 	<li style=""padding-top: 10px;""><strong>Ad Exchange</strong>: A technology platform where publishers and ad networks sell their impressions to advertisers programmatically. It is an online auction for ads, similar to how E-Trade is an online marketplace for stocks. Ad exchanges work with multiple seller sources simultaneously to auction off impressions through real-time bidding or programmatic direct. Ad exchanges often connect to DSPs and SSPs, but advertisers can buy from ad exchanges directly.</li>
 	<li style=""padding-top: 10px;""><strong>Demand-Side Platform (DSP)</strong>: A technology platform that allows advertisers to manage, purchase and optimize programmatic inventory from multiple ad exchanges and SSPs through one interface. Inventory can be purchased through real-time bidding or programmatic direct.</li>
 	<li style=""padding-top: 10px;""><strong>Supply-Side Platform (SSP)</strong>: A technology platform that allows publishers to manage, sell and optimize programmatic inventory for advertisers to bid on. SSPs connect to multiple ad networks, exchanges and DSPs at once to maximize the opportunity to sell inventory.</li>
</ul>

<td style=""vertical-align: top;"" align=""left""><strong>Benefits</strong>:

<td style=""vertical-align: top;"" align=""left""><strong>Benefits</strong>:

<tr>
<td style=""vertical-align: top;"" align=""left""><strong>Limitations</strong>:
Lack of transparency — site reporting often masked

No automation — need to use an IO to contract each buy</td>

Limited inventory — you can only access sites within the exchange
Specific channels — some exchanges specialize in video or mobile, requiring access to multiple exchanges to reach all channels</td>

Steeper learning curve — multiple bidding options allow for greater precision, but it takes longer to master the nuances of buying</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style=""vertical-align: top;"" align=""left""><strong>History</strong>:
Ad networks were the first step in progressing from site-direct buys and are essentially simplified aggregators that can categorize and sell publisher inventory in an easy-to-understand way. The benefit to advertisers is they no longer need to contract dozens of individual sites to reach their audience at scale. The benefit to publishers is they get to sell inventory more effectively than site direct. There are many types of ad networks; most are specialized by vertical, demographic or medium.</td>
<td style=""vertical-align: top;"" align=""left""><strong>History</strong>:
This digital marketplace was the next step in the evolution of digital media buying after ad networks, focusing on audience buying over site buying. The auction-based environment facilitates buying and selling from multiple sites or ad networks simultaneously, bringing efficiencies and targeting advances. Advertisers have better targeting through audience-focused buying, greater visibility into purchased inventory and the ability to choose how much to bid. Publishers can maximize profit by offering inventory to an ad exchange in addition to an ad network, increasing opportunity for ad sales.</td>
<td style=""vertical-align: top;"" align=""left""><strong>History</strong>:
Demand-side platforms are the latest phase in digital media buying's evolution — going beyond site or audience buying and using data in a much deeper way. Programmatic has more data available than any other medium, and this can be used to evaluate each impression individually to determine what it is worth. Using a DSP provides buyers with more precision to reach the right person with the right message at the right time by allowing buyers to bid differently on various factors, such as time of day, geography, data segment and much more. Additionally, DSPs connect to multiple ad exchanges and SSPs, which provide buyers with a one-stop shop to buy all channels from a single source. Publishers benefit from the additional opportunities to sell their inventory.</td>

In December 2016, <a href=""https://www.whiteops.com/methbot"" target=""_blank"">White Ops</a> broke <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/online-advertising/white-ops-blows-lid-off-1-billion-plus-russian-botnet/"" target=""_blank"">news</a> uncovering a massive $1 billion-plus Russian botnet fraud ring, dubbed Methbot. As part of the coverage, White Ops released 4,112 compromised IP addresses which advertisers and technology companies could subsequently block from their campaigns. In many cases though, the damage was already done and advertisers had to accept the billions of ad dollars they had lost to the fraudsters and move on.

Upon hearing the news from White Ops, Goodway Group immediately ran an internal check to assess any impact on our clients’ campaigns. Not surprising to Goodway Group, we were <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goodway-shuts-out-methbot-fraudsters/"" target=""_blank"">virtually unaffected</a> by Methbot with only .004% of total 2016 impressions being delivered on the compromised IP addresses listed from White Ops.

To better understand how we achieved such impressive results, we sat down with this Goodway expert to learn more:

&nbsp;
<h5></h5>
<h5 style=""text-align: left;"">Q: Methbot was one of the most sophisticated fraud rings to ever hit the industry—impacting over a billion dollars of advertising revenue. How was Goodway Group able to avoid delivering on Methbot’s thousands of compromised IP addresses?</h5>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">A: (<em>Scotty</em>) We have five different data science controls in place to protect us against delivering on compromised IP addresses—a global frequency cap, a campaign-specific frequency cap, general IP blacklisting, data center IP blacklisting via Pixalate data, and our proprietary clustering algorithm.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Also earlier this year as part of our exclusive anti-fraud initiative, we cut 13 SSPs from our ecosystem and worked directly with our technology partners to enhance fraud prevention controls. The biggest complement to these algorithms and technology controls is our trading team of 70+ world-class pros. They are vigilant in looking for suspicious activity that technical controls simply can’t catch. For instance, they scrub site lists daily and maintain a healthy blacklist.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">It’s likely the combination of both our human policing efforts and all of our technical controls helped us to shut out Methbot.</p>

<h5>Q: Have you found that one of these controls was more impactful than the others in blocking Methbot or any other type of fraud?</h5>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">A: (<em>Scotty</em>) Each technique works to control a certain aspect of fraud, but, for Methbot specifically, we found the greatest results from our clustering algorithm. White Ops released 4,112 compromised IP addresses, and our clustering algorithm had already blocked 1,877 of them —nearly 46%.</p>

<h5>Q: Wow, that seems like a lot! Do you know how that compares to others in the industry?</h5>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">A: (<em>Scotty</em>) We have a limited ability to see into others’ networks, but we did learn that one other company blocked only 4 out of the 4,112 compromised IPs, so we’re definitely proud of our achievement in comparison. In broader terms though, our clustering algorithm normally identifies about 65K IP addresses on 30 days’ worth of data. So in a given year, we block the equivalent of 156 Methbots’ worth of IP addresses. There is a lot of suspicious activity out there; so if you’re waiting on White Ops or any other fraud technology company to tell you what IPs are bad, you are already behind the race 156X.</p>

<h5>Q: Clearly, the clustering algorithm is an important piece of Goodway Group’s anti-fraud efforts. For all of us non-data scientists, can you please explain what a clustering algorithm is?</h5>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">A: (<em>Scotty</em>) Sure, a clustering algorithm takes a set of data that describes the number of devices we see on an IP address, number of cities, number of browsers, number of operating systems, etc., and  then creates clusters of IP addresses based on that data that can be associated to each other by distance. Clusters of people are separated by geographic distance; for example, the cluster of people you would call your neighbors is determined by their geographic distance from you.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Well, clusters of data are separated by geometric distance (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance"" target=""_blank"">Euclidean</a> distance is the metric we use for anyone interested in the specifics), for instance, the distance between two points on a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system"" target=""_blank"">Cartesian plot</a>. We then look at the distances between those clusters and say, “Well, 95% of our IP addresses are in this cluster, but 5% are in this outlier cluster WAY far away from the rest.” We don’t want those, so we blacklist them. To be fair, we don’t know why <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning"" target=""_blank"">we don’t want them</a>, we just know they are so different from the norm that they look risky to us.</p>

4317,4 Takeaways from Emarketer's Digital Trends for 2017,"<em><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4335 size-full"" title=""4 Takeaways from Emarketer's Digital Trends for 2017"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/eMarketer-digital-trends.jpg"" alt=""woman on phone looking at digital trends"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" /></em>

No industry is as prone to sweeping predictions of massive change as the ad tech industry. But when making predictions about what will happen in the coming 12 months—rather than the upcoming five or ten years—it helps to measure projections with a bit of skepticism.

This means as we reviewed eMarketer's recent report on the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/eMarketer_10_Key_Digital_Trends_for_2017.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">10 Key Digital Trends for 2017</a>, we looked at the numbers, talked with colleagues, and analyzed what else is trending in the programmatic market—all in order to bring you a digest of their top four digital trends that we believe will truly shape the ad industry in 2017:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>More than half of marketers will move to multichannel attribution models</strong>.
As more and more advertising budgets move into the digital space from other channels, marketers are calling for more sophisticated attribution modeling. Most conversion attribution models favor the last-ad-seen approach, which gives credit only to the user’s last interaction with an ad. Savvy marketers realized long ago that this leads to disproportionately giving credit to sites like email clients, which users visit throughout the day, and ignores all other sites that a user visited prior to converting.In 2017, most marketers will catch up, and the days of agencies painting reports with broad, generic brushstrokes will be long gone. We predict many will indeed turn to algorithms focused on full-path conversion analysis. Spend levels and channel diversification necessitating detailed reporting stories to provide accountability into ROI and ROAS will become requirements as well as lay the groundwork for the next (even more successful) programmatic campaign.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4328 size-medium"" title=""4 Takeaways from Emarketer's Digital Trends for 2017"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/multichannel-attribution-300x158.png"" alt=""emarketer chart of trends in digital companies using multichannel attribution models"" width=""300"" height=""158"" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Mobile Messaging apps will continue to make headway</strong>.
Are you a good juggler? You’ll need to be this year. Gone are the days when all of your messaging was in a single app. Now you are Snapping puppy dog replies, group chatting with globe-trotting friends via Facebook Messenger, and instantly sharing your NYE party dress through Instagram Direct. According to the recent eMarketer digital trends report, messaging apps will reach a tipping point with more than half of mobile users on messaging apps in 2017.Go ahead and glue that smartphone to your hand now. Authentically mobile, mobile-first, mobile-centric—no matter your favorite catchphrase—the mobile experience will continue to grow in popularity in 2017. We agree that this will be especially true in the development of new apps and games, but it will also greatly influence strategy, as marketers realize mobile programmatic advertising can’t just be an extension of desktop anymore. So what does this mean for your campaigns? Even if you’re not participating in this ever-multiplying conversation, you’ll want to get educated and educate those around you on how to best use these messaging platforms to deliver your message to their expanding, engaged, and high-frequency audiences.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4329 size-medium"" title=""4 Takeaways from Emarketer's Digital Trends for 2017"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/mobile-messaging-300x281.png"" alt=""emarketer chart of latest changes in mobile phone messaging app users and other digital penetration"" width=""300"" height=""281"" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Many marketers will cash in on social influencers</strong>.
While influencer marketing is still a fairly nascent medium, more and more brand marketers are allocating budgets to YouTubers, Instagrammers, Snapchatters, and bloggers with a strong following. Their target audiences are swayed by the influencers’ opinions and thought leadership, increasing both awareness and favorability of promoted products.While eMarketer is hesitant to put a specific forecast to influencer marketing spending in 2017, they do suggest continued growth in the multibillion dollar industry as consumers grow weary of digital display ads. In the meantime, it’s critical for marketers to learn more about influencer marketing and increase their comfort level with influencer experimentation, or regret being a late adopter of these digital trends.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4330 size-medium"" title=""4 Takeaways from Emarketer's Digital Trends for 2017"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Instagram-300x149.png"" alt=""emarketer chart of trends in digital social media like instagram revenues"" width=""300"" height=""149"" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Must-see streaming TV will surpass primetime programming</strong>.
According to eMarketer, live digital video streaming will prove its worth in 2017, with audience sizes rivaling those of prime-time TV. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/marketers-can-score-big-digital-advertising-football-season/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Twitter’s NFL Thursday Night Football</a> and streams of the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/clinton-and-trump-digital-media-campaigns-by-the-numbers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">presidential debates</a> in late 2016 proved that live TV streaming can work. With Hulu, YouTube, and others also looking to launch live TV services in 2017, we’re betting that “appointment viewing” will be back in your life, sans rabbit ears or a cable TV box. As digital video streaming increases, we predict viewership numbers on a few will reach the heyday of a late 90’s Thursday night must-see TV.I could go on and on—virtual reality, chatbots, and online grocery shopping—but with so many solid ad tech innovations to watch for in 2017, I’ll keep a few in the peripheral view. Regardless of whether we’re spot on or completely off the mark on the above predictions, it's exciting to watch how it will all unfold in 2017!</li>

The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017 was all about <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2017/01/ces-alexa-in-everything/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Alexa</a>, Amazon’s virtual personal assistant that is now the hub of the connected home. CES showcased a <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/whats-alexa-up-to-at-ces-heres-a-running-list-ces-2017/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">long list of home products</a> with full Alexa controls built in—refrigerators, power strips, speakers, dimmer switches, and more.

With the rising popularity of virtual personal assistants like Alexa, we see emerging a new marketing channel—the conversant channel. Conversant channels give brands the opportunity to connect with their audience and interact with their customers one-to-one via chatbots.

We sat down with Jonathan Mellinger, CEO of <a href=""https://utu.ai/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">uTu.ai</a>, for a quick education on the realm of chatbots and what they will mean for marketers and new advertising experiences.
<ol>
 	<li>What makes Alexa so great and what is fueling its rise?</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>Ease of use. Alexa works as advertised. You ask Alexa a question and it responds. If you ask it for information, it accurately returns it. It plays music at your suggestion. It’s an early step in the right direction for creating frictionless experiences from conversational interfaces.</em></p>

<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>Can you help us with the definitions—personal assistants vs. chatbots? What is what and how do they work together?</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>Technically, Alexa is a personal assistant. Amazon uses the term “skills” instead of “chatbot”, and they (and others) have kits that allow developers to build skills on top of Alexa. These skills perform the same “jobs” that chatbots do, only they are voice-activated. Our team recently won a hackathon for creating a skill on Alexa that tracks blood pressure. The applications for skills are manifold.</em></p>

<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>Can you give a real-life scenario in which someone may have already come into contact with a chatbot?</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>It’s quite possible that the customer service bubble that you see in the corner of a webpage is really a chatbot. Type “Kayak” into Facebook Messenger’s search field, and you’ll be interacting with its chatbot to book travel. Think of a chatbot as a mini-app that performs a specific task, like book travel or reservations, recommend and order products, or track fitness goals.</em></p>

<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>How might an ad experience work in conjunction with chatbots, skills, and Alexa?</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>At uTu.ai, we spend a lot of our time thinking about this. This channel, more than any other in digital marketing, offers advertisers the opportunity to communicate with their customers on a one-to-one basis. A standard banner or persistent scroll unit in a chatbot won’t work. Advertising in conversant channels will take a form that is native to the bot and chat experience. This presents advertisers with myriad sponsorship opportunities to communicate with their customers in contextually relevant bots. uTu.ai’s console gives bot-builders flexibility in determining entry points based on engagement, loyalty, or goals, for example. These moments can still include audio, video, text, and all the same creative elements available in mobile or display advertising.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>Alexa isn’t too much different, just no video or images. You may ask Alexa for your bank account balance. After she reports the balance, an airline advertiser, for example, suggests an offer that you could receive 10% off your next seat-upgrade purchase deposited directly into your account—brief, contextually relevant, and unobtrusive.</em></p>

<ol start=""5"">
 	<li>How should marketers and advertisers think about a media strategy that involves chatbots?</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>Careful consideration of their customer. Marketers don’t get many chances to speak or engage directly with their customers. This is a nascent market, and advertising in this channel isn’t yet programmatically enabled. We are focused on introducing similar work flow, audience identification and identity resolution, and targeting to inventory suppliers and buyers. However, marketers and advertisers should begin to think about how they’re going to adjust their website, email, and digital media strategies to take advantage of this new and powerful channel. It will take share of voice from and potentially supplant other strategies in their marketing mix. Tactically, their media strategy should consider what brand message they want to express, content they want to curate and share, and what message they’d convey to their customers if they were talking directly to them because that’s what this channel will enable.</em></p>

<ol start=""6"">
 	<li>How would you describe the audience demographics that come into contact with chatbots?</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>Dominoes’ order bot has 14M Likes, CNN’s headline bot has 25M likes, and Kayak’s travel bot has almost 600K likes. Keep in mind Messenger just released the API’s to build bots in April 2016. I look at “Likes” as a proxy for engagement, so my takeaway is that we’re at a stage where it’s not just early adopters who are using bots anymore. The more digitally savvy, (presumably) younger generation has tried them out, but the broader population is beginning to engage with them. However, what we’re building is the capability for bot-makers to better understand who comprises their audience and to make it easy for advertisers to engage with them.</em></p>","We sat down with Jonathan Mellinger, CEO of uTu.ai, for a quick education on the rising popularity of virtual personal assistants like Alexa and an emerging marketing channel—the conversant channel.

Today more than ever, my conversations revolve less and less around the client’s digital marketing strategy and more often and more appropriately around their marketing strategy in a digital world. Digital, TV, radio and even out-of-home are all beginning to converge at the establishment of a new normal. But as technology and communication evolve, so do new challenges and focuses for marketers.

The past year saw some significant leaps in the digital arena, and 2017 is slated for an even greater acceleration. In this brief blog series, let’s look back on five evolving digital trends from 2016 as well as take a peek at what will inevitably be on the horizon in the very near future.
<h3><strong>The Rising Threat of Ad Blockers</strong></h3>
Marketers’ demand for consumer attention has grown; while at the same time, consumers have been armed with the tools to avoid ads altogether. Estimates from comScore range that anywhere from <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/comscore-1-in-10-people-in-the-us-uses-an-ad-blocker-2016-4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">5 to 20 percent</a> of all U.S. Internet users utilize an ad blocker on their desktop. <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a> predicts that approximately 1 in 4 will install an ad blocker on either desktop or smartphone by the end of 2016, verging on 1 in 3 by 2017. What’s the leading demographic fueling this surge? Millennials. More specifically, millennial men, especially those with a higher income.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4417 size-full"" title=""Digital State of the Union: The Rising Threat of Ad Blockers"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ad_Blockers_Infographic.png"" alt=""stats about blockers in infographic"" width=""1000"" height=""396"" />

There are three important considerations* driving these numbers:
<ol>
 	<li>Publishers can be the biggest losers when it comes to ad blockers because an advertiser will not pay for an ad that is not shown (0 impressions = 0 cost). Some publishers have taken more drastic approaches to avoid mass losses from ad blockers, whereby the page content does not load until the user has disabled his or her ad blocking software. What a way to kill the web-browsing experience!</li>
 	<li>From the advertiser’s perspective, it makes this particular demographic — technophiles, entertainment lovers and automotive junkies especially — increasingly difficult to target. Moving forward, more creative approaches for reaching millennial men will be necessary, leveraging newer platforms for advertisements.</li>
 	<li>The greatest catalyst prompting users to install ad blockers is the category of disruptive ads. Pop-ups, high-impact, in-stream and video ads on both desktop and mobile devices are most commonly cited as unfavorable. The IAB has recently been making headway in disallowing certain types of disruptive ads from being run, which may or may not have an impact on slowing the pace of ad blocker installations. In any case, publishers and advertisers alike may benefit from avoiding sole usage of these formats — a varied marketing mix is often recommended for greater success.</li>
</ol>
With stats like these, is it any wonder that advertisers are rethinking how to capture consumers’ attention? This year, the next frontier in capturing consumers’ eyes will be ensuring website speed (both desktop AND mobile) is optimized. <a href=""https://www.slideshare.net/eMarketerInc/emarketer-webinar-mcommerce-trends-for-2016behind-the-rapid-growth"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Twenty-seven percent</a> of U.S. digital shoppers are unwilling to wait more than three seconds for a page to load, with only 38 percent sticking it out after five seconds.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4418 size-full"" title=""Digital State of the Union: The Rising Threat of Ad Blockers"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Ad_Blockers_Page_Speed.png"" alt=""stats about website speed in infographic"" width=""1000"" height=""396"" />

For advertisers and publishers who promote e-commerce or gauge success on quality traffic and time spent on site, website speed will be the highest priority in the coming year. Consumer attention spans are shortening and so must the page load times.

<strong>Cross-Device Linking and Audience-based Buying</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Tip #1: <em>""Cross-device linking and audience-based buying have matured in the past year. I encourage all our clients to not buy inventory first, but to buy audience first and then make sure that the publications they’re buying with are reasonable.”</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Video Ads</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Tip #2: <em>“Build your spots so they convey everything you need to convey in 5 seconds, and that the next 10 or 25 seconds are bonus time. I see so many video ads today that within 5 seconds they’re still doing the build-up.”</em></li>
</ul>
<strong>Programmatic Inventory Value</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Tip #3: <em>“All programmatic ad inventory, and video almost more than anything, is like buying jewelry or diamonds. If the price is too good, there is a reason for it. I see so many clients and agencies demanding video inventory that is low-priced, and they are not getting what they think they are getting when they’re spending that little bit of money.”</em></li>

Customers today expect an individualized experience, especially in the mobile arena. Across channels and devices, consumers are more likely to act, buy, and recommend when marketers serve up messaging that’s tailored to their wants and needs. The past year saw a greater focus on smarter segmentation and look-alike, or <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-ways-ai-marketing-will-revolutionize-ad-campaigns/"">predictive modeling</a>, which have resulted in a boost in overall programmatic ad performance. In addition, personalized emails, product-specific ads and cross-device technology all play a role in reaching the right audience with the right message at the right time. These have become especially critical with the emergence of micro-moments – those instances where people reflexively turn to a device to act on a need to learn/do/discover/watch/shop.<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4464 size-full"" title=""Digital State of the Union: From Personalization to Personal Assistants"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Chat_Bots_Infographic.png"" alt=""chat bot infographic"" width=""1000"" height=""426"" />

The latest development in personalization, especially one that has an immense potential to change the data-mining game, is chat bots. These digital “personal assistants” provide answers to questions, products to searches, recommendations to queries and so forth.

Beyond a response-based system, however, chat bots are now able to push personalized suggestions to consumers at the right moments, based on event timing, geo-location or recent activity. In 2017, expect to see further development in chat bot utilization, especially for insight development and early-funnel decision influencing.

Moreover, in the next year, keep an eye out for the expansion of <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/should-you-consider-using-beacons/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">beacon</a> implementation, as more event venues and retailers integrate this technology into the customer experience. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/proximity-marketing-need-know/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Beacons</a> can both collect valuable data as well as push notifications and interact with apps already installed on the user’s device.

As these developments continue, advertising personalization will no longer be a cool feature but rather a requirement.

When it comes to content marketing, it's not what you say but how you say it. In 2016, advertisers amplified their efforts in responding to increased consumer desire for valuable content that provides free and useful information in exchange for eyeballs. Helping to solve a problem that an audience is trying to solve provides advertisers with the opportunity to become a trusted go-to source in the field. And once established, the relationship can quickly go from a one-time transaction to a lifetime of brand advocacy.

With consumer attention spans thought to be limited to eight seconds, the key challenge has been providing informative content in a quickly digestible format, such as 15-second instructional videos or infographics. A thoughtful piece of content promoted correctly – whether in the form of native advertising, social promotions, email distribution or forum participation — can drive the right customers to convert. According to B2B marketers in particular, 63% recognize content marketing as having the greatest impact on their business.

Looking ahead to 2017, top-notch content marketing will be expected and will flood the digital space as the next way to break through the clutter. One way that marketers will emerge victorious in their efforts is by way of influencer marketing. Influencer marketing leverages the assistance of social media and key individuals (YouTubers, Instagrammers, Snapchatters, bloggers, etc.) who have a strong impact on a target audience to promote products. The end consumer is influenced by these opinions and thought leadership, increasing both awareness and favorability.

Streaming digital killed the TV star. No longer do we live in an era when we’ll wait for content at a scheduled time. As of 2016, television has officially taken a backseat to streaming digital. And with that shift comes not only a growing number of cord-cutters but an amassed population of cord-nevers. The U.S. population wants video content, and they want it at any time, all the time. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/rise-programmatic-tv-explained-5-graphics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Enter video on demand, over-the-top, connected TV, YouTube and Netflix</a>.

Consumers spend anywhere from 1 to 3 hours each day with streaming digital video (mobile leads the channel charge when you combine smartphone and tablet minutes), leaving a prime opportunity for tech-savvy advertisers, according to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a>:

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4499 size-full"" title=""Digital State of the Union: Streaming Digital"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Streaming_Digital_Infographic.png"" alt=""emarketer stats on digital video in infographic"" width=""1000"" height=""396"" />

It has also been widely observed that simply recycling a television ad online will not cut it anymore. More short-form video is consumed than long-form, giving as seamless and uninterrupted of an experience as possible between users and their content. Yet, consumers still crave immersive experiences that connect them to and with a particular brand. It’s a delicate balancing act that few marketers have mastered.

Pre-recorded content aside, an ever-increasing trend of live-streaming videos is taking place and will continue to blossom well into 2017. Brands that utilize this newer channel will continue to receive more engagement from and prioritization among feeds of subscribers. Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and (of course) Snapchat will all continue pushing this platform as we head into the future of perpetual connectivity and consumption. The key for brands and advertisers, however, will mirror SEO and blogging best practices: iteration, precision and consistency will garner the greatest prioritization as well as response.

Digital advertising costs are going up. Fast. If you haven’t felt it yet, you might want to check under the hood.

When we strip away all the bots and fake sites, supply plummets. At the same time, virtually every advertiser now prioritizes digital in their buy, so demand has skyrocketed. Economics 101 declares that the free market is going to tack on an extra digit to those CPMs because supply certainly is not unlimited, and there are 20 other companies who are chasing that exact same impression. You get what you pay for, and advertisers are wising up to the efficacy of targeting specific audiences with high lifetime value.

It’s important this trend is observed, internalized, and accepted. Those who fail to do so will be throwing their advertising dollars right out the window; those who successfully adjust will observe a tangible and measureable impact on their digital advertising costs.

What’s more, with advances in measurement technologies, we are now able to precisely parse recent online behaviors: the likelihood a consumer will have an affinity for a brand, whether an ad was seen, how long the ad was viewed, whether a site’s traffic is human and the list goes on. But these advances come at a cost.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4515 size-full"" title=""Digital State of the Union: Digital Advertising Costs"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Digital_Advertising_Costs_Infographic.png"" alt=""costs of digital advertising showcased in infographic"" width=""1000"" height=""432"" />

While we can’t make prices go down, what we can do is help you to understand why this is happening in even more detail. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/whats-programmatic-worth/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Click here</a> for free access to <em>What’s Programmatic Costing You: An Insider’s Guide to Understanding the Rising Costs of Programmatic Advertising</em>.

As we head into the new year and continue to keep an eye on the above-mentioned circumstances around digital advertising costs, there is yet another recent game changer: <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/learned-state-digital-industry-dmexco/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">header bidding</a>. Think of header bidding as a pre-auction in advance of inventory entering the open market so more players can participate in the “main event.” More competition is better for everyone, right? Well, yes. And no.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4514 size-full"" title=""Digital State of the Union: Digital Advertising Costs"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Header_Bidding_Infographic.png"" alt=""stats on header bidding ad costs in infographic"" width=""1000"" height=""396"" />

In an ideal setup, it improves forecasting, allows for access to every single impression and creates an even more level playing field for buyers. As it currently stands, however, some DSPs are unable to discern between a “header bid request” and an “open market request,” meaning win rates will plummet due to inability to precisely ascribe value to an impression. Unless you know exactly what an impression is worth to you, it’s spaghetti on the wall, and the wall is coated in oil. Hopefully, 2017 will see a reconciliation between technologies and automated communication, but it remains a challenge in the meantime.

As we’ve learned, digital is changing at a breakneck pace, and none of it is straightforward. Fortunately, Goodway Group has experts observing the minutiae and responding with nimble, calculated moves to keep our clients ahead of the curve.

4531,Choosing a Digital Ad Partner: 5 Questions to Ask,"<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4537 size-full"" title=""Choosing a Digital Ad Partner: 5 Questions to Ask"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Choosing_a_Digital_Ad_Partner_Header.jpg"" alt=""business woman shaking hands and choosing a digital ad partner"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" />

For independent agencies working with small and mid-sized clients, choosing a digital ad partner can be a tough nut to crack. In-house buyers and digital marketers have to keep up with constantly changing technology in order to know how to optimize their ad presence for the greatest impact — and then, they have to spend valuable time comparing stand-alone reports and analytics to share those results with the client!

At some point, you realized you needed more . . . more time . . . more expertise . . . more value-add from a partner who gets it. An RFP probably got plenty of vendors knocking on your door with slick brochures and colorful slide decks, but how do you know which one is the <em>right</em> partner for your company? After the umpteenth proposal, are they are all starting to sound the same?

Before you let the next potential partner leave your conference room, consider asking a few questions that get at the heart of how they are <em>different</em>. Cut through the noise and get to what really matters in choosing a digital ad partner, with these five questions you may not have thought to ask before:
<h3>1. Are they staffed appropriately to support your business?</h3>
Integrating all of your systems and data to work together efficiently is not simple — let alone the day-to-day research, reporting, optimization and account management that’s necessary to keep your clients happy. You’ve already found out you need more than a one-person show running your campaigns behind the curtain. So when choosing a digital ad partner, don’t forget to ask what their support-to-client ratio is to get an idea of the breadth of expertise that will actually be available to your agency. Ask how many years’ experience their average trader has for a quick over/under comparison between vendors. Inquire about who specifically will be dedicated to your business. Then, follow up to find out how many other agencies that team is supporting. You’ll quickly discover if they’re staffed to meet your needs or if it’s all smoke and mirrors.
<h3>2. What is their value-add beyond running media?</h3>
Every client campaign is unique, right? So you need more than a one-size-fits-all solution. What can they give you that everyone else can’t? Perhaps, they are analytics superstars, giving you real-time insights and custom dashboards that integrate all of your data sources into a single digestible report. Maybe, they are your research hub to access leading tools, like eMarketer, comScore and Pathmatics, that you couldn’t otherwise afford. Or it’s possible they have a proprietary technology that enhances targeting optimization or provides additional <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/emarketer-turns-jay-friedman-discuss-ad-tech-fraud-u-s/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">fraud protection</a>. Whatever is in their secret sauce, find out what makes them exceptional.
<h3>3. How do they source their inventory?</h3>
Start by uncovering if they buy from the open marketplace auction, are connected with a particular ad network, utilize a specific DSP or multiple DSPs and/or leverage private marketplace packages. It’s important to understand where their inventory is coming from to gauge if it is high-quality or discount bin rejects. Basically, are they thinking in terms of quantity <em>and</em> quality when it comes to your ad buys? Accessing premium publishers that give you more placements with proven viewability performance is step one. Working with a partner who also has the buying power to get more out of every dollar you spend is step two.
<h3>4. How do they know which campaign elements had the greatest impact on conversion?</h3>
In a constantly changing advertising landscape, every campaign element plays a role in today’s path to conversion. Yet, most ad tech platforms focus only on the last interaction a user had with an ad before converting, which gives disproportionate credit to sites like email clients, where users visit throughout the day, and ignores all other sites that a user visited before converting. One of the most important aspects of choosing a digital ad partner is their ability to test, learn and apply the lessons on a continuous basis. A <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/dont-bother-with-digital-display-if-using-last-click-attribution/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">full path attribution</a> model analyzes all impressions that lead to the conversion so traders can make more informed optimization decisions throughout the entire life cycle of your campaign.
<h3>5. Are they a good cultural fit?</h3>
Of course, you need to make sure their business model is sustainable. Because who wants to partner with a company that won’t be around next year? If they are <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/a-vote-for-the-independent-partner/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">independent</a>, find out how they are able to adapt to the ever-evolving ad tech scene. What technologies are they investing in today to respond to your clients’ needs tomorrow? If they are venture-capital funded or a public company, check out if they are performing well, with plenty of funding to run the business in the months to come. Are their shareholders/stakeholders satisfied? If the answer is no, beware as their immediate focus will be on driving revenue at the expense of servicing the business.

Beyond the numbers, do they demonstrate similar passion, values and principles as your own? Are they willing to do the right thing for your clients no matter what, without pressure from shareholders, stock analysts or ivory tower egos? Be sure to learn more about how their culture will help you and your clients succeed before choosing a digital ad partner.

It’s no surprise that video continues to lead as one of the most powerful mediums for connecting with consumers, but the ways in which they access that content and how marketers buy it are rapidly shifting.

According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a>, 2016 was the first year in which more than half of U.S. digital video advertising was expected to be bought and sold programmatically, accounting for 56% of total digital video ad spending. Even with the increasing adoption of programmatic media buying, there is still a lot of confusion among advertisers about this particular space.

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-4563"" title=""Programmatic Video Explained: Experts and AAF Weigh In"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Perspectives_Programmatic_Video_Cover.png"" alt=""Perspectives on Programmatic Video Report Cover"" width=""156"" height=""237"" />To create some clarity, the <a href=""https://aafcolumbus.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Advertising Federation (AAF) Columbus</a> recently hosted a unique Perspectives on Programmatic Video panel discussion, and I was privileged to participate. The event featured insights on the cable and broadcast world from Chris Locks of <a href=""https://www.ctvmedia.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">CTV Media</a>, opinions about the programmatic marketing technology space from Jennifer Dawson Smith of <a href=""https://www.tubemogul.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adobe/TubeMogul</a>, and my own perspective on how agencies can tap into this new medium. Chrsytie Reep, from <a href=""https://www.fahlgrenmortine.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Fahlgren Mortine</a>, also moderated the discussion, helping direct the conversation to the real-world issues agencies face today.

Those who attended the event were also able to snag a handy guide on programmatic video and TV buying. But for those of you who missed it or those who just need a quick recap, I’m happy to share the highlights below:
<h3>What is the true definition of programmatic media buying?</h3>
“Programmatic” on its own simply refers to automation. Programmatic media buying is automating the process, usually through an ad exchange or a demand-side platform.
<h3>Is Advanced TV the same as Programmatic TV? And what is Addressable TV?</h3>
Nope. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"">Advanced TV</a> is any television content that has evolved beyond traditional, linear television delivery models. This umbrella term is inclusive of interactive TV, connected TV, smart TV, linear addressable, programmatic TV and VOD addressable. Programmatic TV is automated linear TV buying. It streamlines the buying process through automation while layering in enhanced targeting through first-party data and behavioral targets. Whereas, Addressable TV is a targeting capability under the Advanced TV umbrella.
<h3>What are the advantages of Programmatic TV and Advanced TV?</h3>
Programmatic TV and Advanced TV are the evolution and future of traditional TV advertising. They bring greater efficiency through automated buying, enable audience-first targeting allowing you to go beyond the standard demographics of age and gender, and enable more sophisticated optimization metrics than TV GRPs. Furthermore, they can help you connect your audience across different video viewing channels, allowing you to control audience reach and frequency across devices. Now, you can translate offline television audiences to online targetable audiences, reaching “cord cutters” who have completely abandoned traditional TV in favor of streaming services. What’s more, Advanced TV can inform your traditional TV buys. You can apply your insights gained from your digital TV buys to your linear buy in a more efficient and smarter way.
<h3>What’s next for Advanced TV?</h3>
To be blunt, it will keep advancing (no pun intended). The space needs time to mature and evolve. Right now, there are many walled gardens, a lack of aggregated inventory and conflict between seller sources. But as the walls come down, enhanced data will become available and buying sources will consolidate. This will lead to a greater volume of inventory that programmatic media agencies can access, enabling marketing to invest more into the space. An enhanced investment will help spur further advances in technology in the space leading to deeper reporting, which will help improve campaign optimization. This will bring data that proves the channel as valuable and spurs even further adoption, and the investment cycle will continue.

Do you ever feel like you’re shooting for a constantly moving target in ad tech? Keeping up with the evolving digital landscape can be time-consuming, but luckily for you, there are a variety of programmatic advertising tips and industry events to keep you in the know on digital media — like last week’s <a href=""https://industrypreview.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AdExchanger 2017 Industry Preview</a>!

The New York City affair hosted an impressive turnout of industry’s most influential players and showcased some of the hottest technology products and trends for 2017. If you didn’t get the chance to check it out, don’t worry! We spoke with industry experts across the board and recapped the three essential programmatic advertising tips you’ll need for success in the year ahead:
<h3>1. Authenticity &amp; Relevance of Content</h3>
Today’s consumers expect to be shown ads that are intrinsically relevant to them. It isn’t enough to reach your target audience anymore; now the content also needs to be authentic and meaningful to the individual for optimal impact. Campaign success is often judged on the answer to a single question, “Was the content actually consumed?” Just because your target audience landed on the right page with your ad doesn’t mean they were actually impacted by your message. Leverage more than sophisticated targeting capabilities to engage users; go the extra mile to make the experience enjoyable, meaningful and relevant for each precise user in order to influence their brand perceptions and decisions.
<h3>2. Holistic Approach to Buying &amp; Planning</h3>
How often do you use devices beyond your desktop for those “I want to know,” “where do I go,” and “how do I buy” moments in the day? Chances are, you’ve already used your phone or tablet at least once today — whether it was checking your Facebook feed during breakfast, listening to your favorite Spotify playlist on the go or streaming the latest reality TV competition from your couch. With the fluidity of today’s technologies, a cross-device approach is a necessity for media planners and buyers. Marketers need to have a holistic view of the inventory and environments available, or they will risk missing out on reaching consumers in several stages of their daily journey.
<h3>3. Multi-Touch Data Integration</h3>
I’ve heard many marketers say, “We have lots of data across several marketing systems about our consumers’ daily habits and preferences . . . now what? How do we bring it all together? What programmatic advertising tips do you have to solve for this one?”

One of the greatest challenges in marketing is capitalizing on data that is spread across several disconnected resources. Often, different devices will capture different user IDs, making it extremely difficult to manually merge key information. In 2017, many believe there will finally be a data integration breakthrough as advertisers demand a multi-touch attribution model that really works across platforms. For example, the travel and hospitality industries are already teaming up to build new bridges when it comes to sharing flight, hotel and credit card spending data. When data is integrated across all offline and online platforms, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-ways-ai-marketing-will-revolutionize-ad-campaigns/"">marketers will be able to target</a> current and new audiences even more effectively and make extremely efficient media buys.

Initially catching the attention of all on the call by strumming the popular intro to Green Day’s 1997 hit Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), digital media trader Kelsey Shaw began, “Another user’s on, so let’s display our ads,” and everyone was hooked! Marrying the music with ad tech lyrics, Kelsey translated viewability advertising rules into a language that listeners could understand and enjoy.

4591,Super Bowl's Biggest Online Advertisers: Did They Run TV Commercials?,"<img class=""size-full wp-image-4597 aligncenter"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Super_Bowl_Header.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1000"" height=""348"" />

Last night’s Super Bowl thrilled audiences worldwide, from the Patriots’ unprecedented fourth-quarter comeback to a historic first-time-ever overtime to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txXwg712zw4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Lady Gaga’s dramatic halftime entrance and exit</a>. At Goodway, we have Patriots fanatics and Falcons supporters — and plenty of employees who don’t follow either team — but as marketing professionals all of us care about the ads. Of course, we watched the commercials and picked our favorites, but we also wanted to know who the Super Bowl's biggest online advertisers were yesterday. Did Super Bowl advertisers support their TV spots with digital spending?

<img class=""size-full wp-image-4601 aligncenter"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/super_bowl_chart.png"" alt="""" width=""1000"" height=""404"" />

We checked leading display and mobile intelligence <a href=""https://www.pathmatics.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pathmatics</a>’ estimated digital spending this morning and found that seven of the top digital advertisers also purchased a traditional TV commercial during the big game. Based on the data, TurboTax, Honda, Procter &amp; Gamble, T-Mobile, Google, 20th Century Fox (<em>Logan</em> trailer), and Ford all supplemented their ""big ticket"" television ads with digital campaigns. Of these seven, all supported their TV spots with banner and video ads except <em>Logan</em>, which only advertised digitally using banners. What’s more, among the six advertisers that ran supporting <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/programmatic-video-explained-experts-aaf-weigh/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">video ads</a>, all included the original Super Bowl ad in their creative mix, often in addition to other video spots.

It’s a curious move on 20th Century Fox’s part to not advertise with online video because trailers are typically the main way to advertise a movie. Perhaps the Super Bowl spot used the majority of 20th Century Fox’s marketing budget, leaving too little left for a digital video campaign? Another possibility here is that 20th Century Fox released the ad as a teaser and will ramp up digital spending closer to the movie’s release in early March. Either way, it feels like a missed opportunity to build on the excitement of the trailer and further promote the movie.

What about the advertisers that spent online leading up to and following the Super Bowl but were not among the live commercials broadcast in the big game? The NBA, Geico and CBS were all big spenders yesterday. The NBA spent an estimated $1.2 million on banners and videos across all devices. It makes sense that the organization would want to stay top of mind but not step on the NFL’s toes and advertise during the game. Geico also pursued a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">cross-device advertising strategy</a>, featuring ads from its various campaigns. Perhaps Geico didn’t feel the need to debut a new campaign during the Super Bowl because of their robust year-round strategy and wide brand recognition. Finally, CBS advertised heavily yesterday, promoting a variety of shows. It hosted the Super Bowl last year and likely didn’t want to give a rival network any money; so avoiding the game seems like the right play.

Whether you are a Super Bowl advertiser or not, we always recommend an omnichannel strategy. Today’s <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/rise-programmatic-tv-explained-5-graphics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">consumers are still watching linear TV</a> for live events like the Super Bowl, but they are also dividing their attention among other devices and channels, particularly online and mobile. A holistic media mix should incorporate all channels to reach your audience wherever they are watching.

From artificial intelligence to an ongoing M&amp;A blitz to the Russian Methbot fraud ring, 2016 was certainly a newsworthy year for those in digital marketing. As we prepare for whatever new technologies or trends will come our way in 2017, let’s take a moment to reflect on the top programmatic headlines that defined the space in 2016.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4628 size-full"" title=""A Year in Review: Top Programmatic Headlines of 2016"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Programmatic_Headlines_1.png"" alt=""Google Header Bidding Programmatic Headlines on tablet screen"" width=""1000"" height=""364"" />

<strong>The End of Header Bidding? Google Opens Up Dynamic Allocation to Outside Demand</strong>

Header bidding dominated programmatic headlines in early 2016, as more than half of publishers jumped on the bandwagon for an alternative to Google’s DoubleClick, according to a <a href=""https://digiday.com/technorati-soti-download/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Digiday and Technorati</a> report. Header bidding was the publishers’ way to get around Google’s seemingly biased setup. Then in April, <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/platforms/the-end-of-header-bidding-google-opens-up-dynamic-allocation-to-outside-demand/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google answered the call</a> and announced a change to its DoubleClick for Publishers ad server called DFP First Look. Recognizing the threat to its business model, Google was forced to change its bidding process by bringing in real-time bids of a publisher’s outside exchange partners to its dynamic allocation product. Despite the launch of First Look, the demand for a more open ad tech ecosystem continues to be strong enough that the <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/08/22/header-bidding-versus-google-first-look"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">battle between header bidding and Google</a> is expected to wage on well into 2017.

<strong>Facebook Is Shutting Down Its Desktop-Based Ad Retargeting Exchange</strong>

The availability of Facebook’s display ad inventory via FBX in 2012 was expected to have a significant impact on the ad ecosystem. With Facebook controlling 25% of ad inventory at the time, according to comScore, it’s massive high-quality inventory pool bolstered the legitimacy of the real-time bidding (RTB) market. However, when <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/facebook-shutting-down-its-desktop-based-ad-retargeting-exchange-171686/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Facebook shut down FBX </a>permanently in 2016, it highlighted the significance of the shift in consumer social usage to mobile devices. It also signaled the strength of Facebook’s more developed built-in ad platforms, such as Dynamic Ads and Custom Audiences. Thus raising its walls even higher, Facebook has turned its attention to producing results from within its own platform.

<strong>ANA's K2 Report: Evidence of 'Pervasive' Agency Rebate Collection</strong>

In June, the <a href=""https://adage.com/article/agency-news/ana-k2-find-evidence-pervasive-agency-rebate-collection/304347/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Association of National Advertisers (ANA) shocked the industry with a controversial report</a> claiming that media agencies in the U.S. have been keeping rebates and kickbacks from media suppliers to shift business their way — with the ANA labeling the deception as “pervasive” among agencies. Backlash from the agency sector immediately called out the ANA’s blanket allegation as unfair and unverifiable since the ANA refused to share the identities of the companies in the report. Regardless, the programmatic headlines it made opened the door for clients and agencies in conference rooms across the U.S. to <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/real-root-cause-kickbacks-client-agency-challenges/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">have more meaningful conversations</a> on what success looks like for both sides of the relationship moving forward. In 2017, we can expect to see stronger client-agency partnerships as they begin to understand the possible results and limitations of an ad campaign from each other’s perspective.

<strong>Dentsu to Buy Majority Stake in Data Marketing Firm Merkle</strong>

Continuing the digital M&amp;A trend started in 2015, the market saw significant consolidation last year as some of the world’s largest holding companies sought to round out their capabilities and add new digital revenue streams to their core business services. In a flurry of acquisition activity among programmatic headlines, Dentsu Aegis doubled down in the fall with its purchase of <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/dentsu-to-buy-majority-stake-in-data-marketing-firm-merkle-1470650402"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">data marketing firm Merkle</a> in August and <a href=""https://adage.com/article/agency-news/dentsu-aegis-network-buy-programmatic-shop-accordant/305681/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">trading desk Accordant</a> in September. Despite the fact that we can expect to see more strategic partnerships emerge in 2017, the recent grab for digital firms begs the question, who’s left? And what’s the cost of losing one of the firm’s key differentiators — <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/284001/does-independence-matter.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">their independence</a>?

<strong>Finally, An Ad Tech IPO! The Trade Desk Has Filed Documents to Go Public</strong>

A rising tide will raise all ships. That was the hope, at least, when <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/the-trade-desk-files-for-ipo-2016-8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Trade Desk</a> announced its plans for an initial public offering (IPO) in August. Like many successful IPOs, The Trade Desk brings a highly sustainable business model — in 2015, the company generated $113.8 million in revenue, up 155.5% year-on-year. According to Forbes, after The Trade Desk’s shares jumped more than 55% on its first morning as a public company, the industry has been cautiously optimistic that this could raise the bar for ad tech IPOs and encourage other firms to follow.

<strong>Adobe's Acquisition of TubeMogul: An Ad Tech Consolidation Tipping Point</strong>

Keeping with the market consolidation theme of previous months, Adobe announced its plan to <a href=""https://digiday.com/platforms/adobes-acquisition-tubemogul-ad-tech-consolidation-tipping-point/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">acquire video demand-side platform TubeMogul</a> in November. The related programmatic headlines came on the heels of the <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/03/to-beef-up-in-marketing-tech-salesforce-is-buying-krux-for-340m-in-cash-and-stock-potentially-750m-overall/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Salesforce plan to acquire data management platform Krux</a> in an effort to expand the company's marketing and ad tech footprint. Acquisitions like these signify a unique shift happening in the marketplace, from segment- and demographic-based buying to more modern people-based marketing. Technology companies also want to compete from end to end, so buyers are looking to strategic partnerships like these to bridge the gap with fully-integrated solutions.

<strong>Russian 'Methbot' Fraud Steals $180 Million in Online Ads</strong>

According to White Ops, Methbot is a very advanced fraud operation on a scale no one's seen before, stealing between $3 and $5 million a day from the online ad industry. In an attempt to coordinate an industrywide effort to stop Methbot, White Ops went public with over 4,110 compromised IP addresses, which advertisers and technology companies could subsequently block from their campaigns.

4646,How Core Values Inspired Our Maternity Leave Policy,"<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4650 size-full"" title=""How Core Values Inspired Our Maternity Leave Policy"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Core_Values_Header.jpg"" alt=""Pregnant woman sitting at desk in home office showing core values"" width=""1000"" height=""637"" />

Among Goodway Group’s core values, at the center of who we are and what we do are “<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/about/history/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Family Values</a>.” For us, this means being there for each other when life happens.

For every big deadline, we know there’s also a big championship game. For every client presentation deck, we’ve seen pictures from a child’s graduation. From birthdays to births, new houses to new names and sadly, lost loved ones to unforeseeable disaster, we’re there for each other in all of life’s moments.

It’s with these core values in mind that Goodway has tried to anticipate the major life events of its employees and provide the best benefits available from day one, like <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/6-tips-for-managing-a-virtual-workforce/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">work-from-home jobs</a>. As for maternity leave, however, Goodway’s benefits have historically been run-of-the-mill. While our maternity benefit was on par with many organizations of our size across the country, our employee population is <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/corporate-culture-matters/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">75% female</a>, average age of 34 — making employees prime candidates to take advantage of a world-class maternity program.

Many organizations ask for feedback from their employees — through annual surveys or focus groups — but Goodway is different. Not only do we have an anonymous suggestion forum to tap into the needs of employees, but responses are crafted personally by our department heads, COO and President and distributed company-wide every Friday. They keep it real, simply because they care.

The maternity leave discussion first came up because of a received inquiry from the suggestion forum. One of our leadership team members responded with honesty and authenticity, sharing that they would look into it. This wasn’t a cop out; our leadership team takes every one of these suggestions to heart. In true Goodway fashion, our leadership team discussed the possibilities at length, researched and benchmarked against similar companies, weighed the financial and legal implications and launched an all-employee survey to get a pulse on if this request was an emerging trend or the whim of a few. The results were clear: Our employees were ready for a change in this benefit area to better match our core values.

I’m happy to share that starting in 2017, our maternity benefits are at the head of the pack: New moms can take 12 weeks after the birth of a child at 100% pay after two years of service (60%-100% pay for those with less than two years’ tenure). Additionally, we added paid time off for new dads and new parents of adopted children.

Goodway knows, of course, there is a link between exceptional benefit programs like ours and employee retention and engagement, but that’s not why they did it. When it comes down to it, our leadership believes it’s the right thing to do. And while the upgraded maternity leave program received an overwhelmingly positive response, it was the transparency in which feedback was requested and decisions were made that truly set Goodway’s approach apart from other organizations.

When our employees go through joyous milestones or hard times outside of work, we show respect, flexibility and support to help them get through whatever happens. So the question is, do you want to work for a company that cares about you beyond the 9-to-5 clock, or one that doesn’t?

<em><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4693 size-full"" title=""Ask the Expert: What Your Digital Advertising Strategy Is Costing You"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Digital_Ad_Partner_Bake-off_Strategy_Header.jpg"" alt=""digital advertising strategy of people with overlapping hands in a huddle"" width=""1000"" height=""550"" /></em>It's common practice in today’s ad world for planners to divvy up media dollars among a number of similar providers in order to test performance. Since most providers have the full array of media capabilities in their toolbox, this may seem like an easy digital advertising strategy to compare multiple partners at once, apples to apples.

While some reps may feel like it’s their duty to their client to compare providers, this actually can have some drawbacks. If you’re using a multi-vendor digital advertising strategy, you might be missing out on some significant benefits, which we recently explored in a Q&amp;A session with our COO <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/about/leadership/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jay Friedman</a>:
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>1.</strong>    <strong>How did this practice of parsing out media dollars among multiple vendors come about? What do you think is the driver of why media planners do this?</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>In the early-mid 2000s there were so many ad networks and ad tech companies launching, each gathering tens of millions of dollars in venture capital money, that agencies had (justifiable) difficulty sorting through who did what and who was better. This was the first time the media sale had to be trusted without being able to be verified. What I mean by this is that sales reps would tell agencies that “the algorithm does this and that,” but the buyer couldn’t verify it. The buyer could always verify print circulation or TV ratings, but this was unverifiable, especially in the early days. Because there was no way to tell who was best, this “bake-off” situation was born and agencies defaulted to comparing ad tech vendors based on performance.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>2.</strong>    <strong>How should planners handle buys that are only accessible through specialty providers — i.e., the very newest/niche native, video or mobile products that advertisers want to test out?</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>Agencies can’t ignore these, but they shouldn’t test them just because they’re new either. Three things agencies should remember: First, just because it’s new doesn’t mean it’s good. It has to align with the target audience. Second, it should align with the target better than where the agency is already spending. Third, there will always be ten times more opportunities that are actually worth buying than there is budget. The very best opportunities that do the very best at achieving marketing goals should get the money since buying everything that clears the threshold is beyond any advertiser’s budget.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>3.</strong>    <strong>What does an agency lose by parsing out budget among multiple vendors?</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>1) Frequency control.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>2) Any one vendor getting the optimization benefits of having all of the data from which to build better intelligence. More data ALWAYS equals a better ability to optimize.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>3) Confidentiality and trade secrets. Parsing out budgets among multiple vendors is like blowing a dandelion in the wind. All of the performance intelligence about your brand — what media works, what audiences work, their seasonality — gets seen by multiple vendors. These vendors have turnover like anyone else, but the impact on your business is multiplied when you’ve spread knowledge around. Their employees go to other places and have no reason not to share this knowledge with your competitors!</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>4.</strong>    <strong>What are some of the non-media challenges you’ve encountered when an advertiser works with multiple vendors?</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>Billing reconciliation can become challenging and actually costly to an agency. Additionally, using five vendors requires five sets of ad tags, five sets of reporting (even if you have an ad server you should pay attention to each vendor’s own reporting), five IOs and five invoices.</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>5. </strong>   <strong>There are some obvious practical advantages that consolidating and choosing one digital advertising strategy and programmatic partner would have for an advertiser — a single point of contact for all media buys, standardized reporting and reduced administrative costs. Are there any less obvious benefits that advertisers should consider?</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>As mentioned above, it consolidates optimization learning into one place. This speeds up optimization and helps an advertiser get better performance faster. Managing frequency is also valuable. Finally, there is the ability to influence your vendor’s product planning and roadmap. If you’re spending $100k/month with five different vendors, you’ll not likely get heard by any of those vendors regarding products you’d like to see built. If you’re spending a half a million per month with one vendor, your voice will be heard loud and clear!</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>6.</strong>    <strong>Why do you believe some advertisers aren’t cutting down on the number of programmatic vendors they work with?</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>FOMO (fear of missing out) is #1. So many companies with so many fancy logos — what if I pick the wrong one? But I’d worry more about picking too many than picking the wrong one. I also think there is a lack of understanding by advertisers around what challenges come with spreading out the budget. Finally, I think advertisers think if they never commit they’ll never get burned. Kind of like, “If I always date multiple people and never marry anyone, I can’t get too hurt!” Well, correct, but as anyone who’s been in love will tell you, it’s better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all!</em></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>7.  </strong> <strong> There is a risk in putting all your eggs in one basket. How can agencies be sure they are choosing the right digital advertising strategy and programmatic partner?</strong></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 60px;""><em>There’s the chance you can choose the wrong partner. I think that’s OK. I think it’s better to choose a slightly less-than-perfect partner and commit than it is to spread spending around for all of the reasons above.</em></p>

<h4><strong>Everyone loves to talk about themselves! Give us your career story . . . in a tweet.</strong></h4>
From print space in Yellowbook (yes, people still used the yellow pages in 2003) to digital solutions at Ziplocal, I’ve always had a knack for ad sales!
<h4><strong>When friends and family ask what you do all day, how do you explain it?</strong></h4>
I typically say that I am in digital advertising and marketing and my job is helping agencies and clients find the best way to reach their audience online.
<h4><strong>If you had to describe what you do as a superpower, what would it be?</strong></h4>
I keep clients happy. Always. What’s your superpower?
<h4><strong>What has been your greatest accomplishment or Career growth opportunity at Goodway Group?</strong></h4>
Every year at Goodway, I have grown the business I am responsible for and continually brought in new clients. In year one, I sold approximately $1MM, and by year five, I had sold over $11MM. From starting off with no book of business to now having one of the largest at the company has been one of my greatest career growth accomplishments. But going from someone who was asking for advice to one who is typically giving advice has also been a cool turn of events!
<h4><strong>Why do you care about what we do at Goodway?</strong></h4>
I love the programmatic space. Goodway has been in programmatic since the very beginning, and having been on the forefront of this space for the past five years has been a tremendous experience and career growth opportunity for me! When I speak to most people, they know very little about how digital advertising really works or how we target audiences. Because I am constantly learning at Goodway, I truly know our industry at a very deep level and have a greater appreciation for what it is we do.
<h4><strong>What do you love about Goodway Group?</strong></h4>
Since I began, it has been like working for a family. The hands-on nature of Dave Wolk (Goodway’s President) has been key in helping to foster the amazing culture at Goodway. Being able to work with people who are focused on solving problems and doing what is right for the client enables all of us to do our best work and enjoy what we do. Rarely, have I worked somewhere with such a positive attitude and can-do culture, but at Goodway that is how we live every day.
<h4><strong>If you’re working from home, how are you not tempted to watch Netflix all day?</strong></h4>
I am so used to working virtually that I am not really sure what it is like to work at an office anymore. Of course, it was a learning curve at first — making sure my wife didn't scream for me while I was on conference calls or dodging all the usual jokes from my family about how I don’t actually work. However, once I got into the routine, it was quite easy to sit down and focus on my work. I am actually more productive in a virtual environment because I don’t have all the same water-cooler-type distractions an office environment has.

Now, I’m able to drop my son off at daycare and pick him up; just being able to spend time with my kids rather than rushing out the door for a one-hour commute to an office is priceless!  And to be honest, I don’t even have a Netflix account. With two little kids, I barely even watch TV.
<h4><strong>If we stopped by your house next Saturday, what would we find you doing?</strong></h4>
Enjoying quality family time — spending time with my 6 month old, my 2½ year old and my wife.

<h4><strong>Everyone loves to talk about themselves! Give us your career story . . . in a tweet.</strong></h4>
An ex-journalist turned social media guru, I jumped into the ad agency fast lane with auto clients before joining the programmatic bandwagon in 2012.
<h4><strong>OK . . . so how did you end up at in a remote work job at Goodway Group?</strong></h4>
My husband is in the U.S. Army, and in 2012, we were stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where I was commuting an hour each way to Nashville to work for a small market research shop. My sister had been working at Goodway for a year at the time and told me they had an opening that would fit my military lifestyle (frequent moves) perfectly. My first memories of interviewing with Goodway were of chatting with two of my potential supervisors and loving them both immediately. They were very genuine and easy to talk to, and they are still some of my favorite people at Goodway to this day! Thinking about it today and writing this still makes me just so thankful.
<h4><strong>When friends and family ask what you do all day, how do you explain it?</strong></h4>
My journey at Goodway has been so exciting and exhilarating — Account Planner to Client Services Supervisor to my role today as Campaign Operations Director — I have learned so much! My current job is to supervise Supervisors. It’s much less ‘big brother’ than it sounds; ultimately, I make staffing decisions; coach and mentor my team of nine Supervisors; lead calls; work on department and company projects; and brainstorm ideas to make processes faster, easier and better for my team.
<h4><strong>What’s your favorite part about your job?</strong></h4>
The opportunities I've been given at Goodway have opened up a whole new passion for me, in my work life and my personal life. Many of the things I am learning about management and leadership are not only applicable to work but can be applied to my friendships, my marriage, my parenting and life, in general, as well.
<h4><strong>What has surprised you most about REMOTE WORK AND working here?</strong></h4>
I think the thing that has surprised me the most about working at Goodway is the work-from-home aspect, which is the biggest draw initially for most people, kind of fades away into the background when you see how awesome the people and the culture are. Sure, it's great that we get to work from home with our cats in our pajamas, but it's even more awesome that we get to work with people who care about what they do. People here are accountable for their work; are kind, supportive and have your back; are super talented and great problem solvers and work every day to make Goodway even better.
<h4><strong>If you’re working from home, how are you not tempted to watch Netflix all day?</strong></h4>
The thing that makes Goodway's remote work environment work is the people we hire — people who are accountable for their work and take pride in what they contribute to their teams. Working virtually means you can work in your pajamas (or yoga pants, like me), and you can run to the gym when you have a free hour. But working virtually also means if you are on Eastern time and it's 8 p.m. but your coworker on Pacific time needs something, you can jump on your laptop and send it to them from your couch.
<h4><strong>What do you miss about office life?</strong></h4>
I sometimes miss getting dressed in a cute outfit and having someone actually see it!
<h4><strong>If we stopped by your house next Saturday, what would we find you doing?</strong></h4>
I am married with two daughters — 2 and 4 years old. They are a handful! Our weekends are usually spent chasing the girls around some outdoor mall or park, eating out at one of our favorite restaurants or hanging at one of the many street festivals or events around the city. When they’re not giving me enough of a workout, you will find me in the gym or out taking photos of everything — I’m an Instagram addict.

<h4><strong>Everyone loves to talk about themselves! Give us your career story . . . in a tweet.</strong></h4>
After dipping my toe into the media waters with a few news organizations, non-profits and institutions, I excitedly jumped off the deep end with Goodway. Cannonball!
<h4><strong>There are lots of ad tech companies to work for, so why Goodway Group?</strong></h4>
What first caught my attention about the job post was the phrase, ""willing to train if you're a fit."" To me, it was a clear statement that this company wasn’t just looking for resumes to fill skill gaps;  they were looking for real human beings that would fit the company culture.
<h4><strong>When friends and family ask what you do all day, how do you explain it?</strong></h4>
I usually lose my parents before I can finish the first sentence, but I tell my more tech-savvy friends that I get to spend millions of dollars each month analyzing data points that allow me to pinpoint the needs of a particular audience and match those needs with my client’s products.
<h4><strong>How has Goodway Group helped you Keep Learning to grow personally and professionally?</strong></h4>
When I graduated, I wanted a challenging profession; and in ad tech, I got it. At Goodway, a huge part of my success has been due to the excellent training programs, peer review system and mentorship pairing. With Goodway’s support, I started as a media coordinator a little over a year ago and was promoted to media trader after just five months.
<h4><strong>Why do you care about what we do at Goodway?</strong></h4>
I like to be the first to know about change, and the more I work in this industry, the more I think it's a good fit for my curious nature. Digital media changes fast, and adapting to industry change requires constant learning. Goodway doesn't merely adapt, here we are encouraged to be pioneers.
<h4><strong>What has surprised you most about working here?</strong></h4>
You don't often see the president of a company dancing at center stage with his employees, and I surely didn't receive a personal congratulation on my promotion from any other executives I worked with in the past, but Goodway’s President, Dave, is a different kind of leader.
<h4><strong>How does this remote work thing actually work?</strong></h4>
Working virtually means I spend less time preparing for and stressing about my workday — no make-up time, no road rage, no fear of inclement weather — every day starts with me being in my best work mindset. Here are just a couple of the other perks: I can take my time drinking the whole pot of coffee and fish is always an option for lunch! Seriously though, the best part about working virtually is the flexibility that I have with my actual work location. I have the freedom to move back home to take care of my parents when needed, the freedom to support my boyfriend if he needs to relocate for his job and the freedom from office cubicles everywhere I go. I think the biggest impact of working virtually is how the power of choice liberates me to have the adventure of a lifetime anytime I want.
<h4><strong>What hours does everyone have to work since you’re all in different time zones?</strong></h4>
My team is very good at catering our work hours to our clients' needs. All of my team members log in during our clients' normal work hours. Management is also pretty lenient about time zone differences, in my opinion. I think it's due to the fact that everyone here is trustworthy and honors their end of the bargain.
<h4><strong>What do you miss about office life?</strong></h4>
I honestly don’t miss anything about office life, aside from the occasional junk-food fest, which is probably a good thing for my waistline.
<h4><strong>If you’re working from home, how are you not tempted to watch Netflix all day?</strong></h4>
My focus is the same, if not better, when working from home since there are no office distractions. The workload at Goodway is not light, which requires me to be truly efficient in managing my time. Once I start work, I tune out all distractions and only focus on the task at hand. I used to try listening to podcasts or music while working, but formulas don't just pop up in my head if Freakonomics is stressing about barefoot running.

I knew when I signed up for Goodway that I wanted the work equivalent of a Himalayan hike, not a Bahamas cruise. And I’m so glad that’s what I got . . . . Plus, my boyfriend would be mad if I get ahead of him on our Netflix binge.
<h4><strong>If we stopped by your house next Saturday, what would we find you doing?</strong></h4>
You probably wouldn’t see me there — weekends are my outdoor adventure time! Rain or shine, I go for a long hike or a mountain bike ride, followed by a trip to the library and a brewery tour. While I have many hobbies, going 20 mph down rocky trails for hours on my mountain bike never gets old. When I’m not outdoors, I’m cooking. I know they say taco is life, but Vietnamese cuisine is the Zeus of food.

Under 90 days into the new year and many retailers are already promoting swimsuit season! With “Get Healthy” listed as the number one resolution in 2017, according to <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/2017-new-year-s-resolutions-most-popular-how-stick-them-n701891"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">NBC News</a>, fitness centers across the country have been busy with people working toward that beach body.

Whether they’re jogging on a treadmill, pumping 200 pounds of iron or stretching in the downward dog pose, chances are they brought some form of digital entertainment to pass the time. According to a survey conducted by Netflix, more than half of users preferred the digital distraction from binge-watching while exercising over lounging on the couch, making this the perfect time of year to shake up your media mix with new marketing solutions.

Make programmatic audio and video planning your spring resolution, and don’t miss your chance to connect with these highly engaged consumer groups:

<strong>Cardio Theater Buffs</strong>

For cardio addicts who select the treadmill, elliptical or stationary bike as their fitness equipment of choice, a favorite television show will often provide the necessary diversion to make their workout more enjoyable. While most gyms offer television screens attached to cardio machines, the channels may be limited and commercials load too long for viewers to stomach. According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a>, 62% of users turn to digital video for its on-demand capabilities, while 45% of viewers prefer digital video over linear TV due to the reduced number of commercials per episode or video.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-4919 size-full"" title=""Programmatic Audio and Video Planning for a Knockout 2017"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Programmatic-Audio-and-Video-Planning-Chart.jpg"" alt=""programmatic audio planning chart from eMarketer"" width=""644"" height=""503"" />

No longer at the mercy of cable and broadcast schedules, many people come to the gym with their own personal device — phone or tablet — and stream their favorite videos. It’s this shift to on-demand television that has made <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/rise-programmatic-tv-explained-5-graphics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">digital video advertising</a> a popular choice for advertisers in recent years. With <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/top-3-tips-programmatic-video-advertising-2017/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">programmatic video</a>, advertisers can utilize first-party and third-party data segments and contextual targeting to identify specific audiences. Additionally, programmatic video planning means you can take advantage of a variety of ad formats and extensive targeting options to broaden the campaign for highly engaged, gym-going viewers.

With video CPMs nearly four times that of banners, I know what your next question will be, “How effective is video at actually converting customers?” With video, paying more means getting more. Goodway’s data scientists have found that our video campaigns typically convert just under five times as many prospects as banners alone. Before you start shifting all of your budget into programmatic video planning, consider this: When our clients ran banners in conjunction with video ads, the conversion rate jumped to ten times that of banners alone!

<strong>Weight-Lifting Rhythms</strong>

According to a recent <a href=""https://www.spotify.com/us/brands/insights/music-streamers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Spotify Brand Impact Study</a>, 32 percent of users stream music most often while they are exercising. No matter if they are weight lifting, cross-training or kickboxing, your customers are tuned in to their earbuds for the energy to take their workout to the next level. Although music tastes vary widely, people often crave songs that fit the tone of their workout. With the popularity of streaming music apps through Spotify and Pandora, many have moved away from personal playlists to streaming channels pre-curated with songs trending for their specific activity.

Through <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advertisers-tuning-audio/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">programmatic audio</a>, advertisers have access to this extremely relevant audience information and can utilize it to target specific users based on the perceived mood. For instance, an auto manufacturer may see strong results from heavy-metal and electronic dance lists that pump adrenaline and excitement into the listener’s veins, whereas a pharmaceutical advertiser may prefer songs with a slower tempo that have a soothing effect and bring awareness to the body and its surroundings.

<strong>Pavement Pacers</strong>

We haven’t forgotten about those who turn to music’s motivational powers during outdoor interval training, such as running, cycling or swimming. A recent study commissioned by Spotify found that more than <a href=""https://thestandard.com.ph/lifestyle/wellbeing/197863/runners-go-the-extra-mile-on-spotify.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">75 percent of runners rely on music</a> to achieve peak performance. Typically, pop songs that ramp up into high-energy choruses work well to keep listeners moving throughout the entire workout, and repetitive beats can make pacing easier to synchronize movements to the music.

In the same way, programmatic audio makes it easier for advertisers to get into an efficient stride more quickly. Advertisers can immediately leverage first-party and third-party data segments as well as target contextually to ensure they are hitting the ideal audience in the right environment. Then as the campaign ramps up, advertisers can see how their ads are performing in real time, giving them the opportunity to adjust for even better performance in their programmatic audio and video planning.

During the <a href=""https://socialmediaweek.org/newyork/"">2017 Social Media Week NYC</a>, hundreds of professionals gathered to share what paid social advertising trends are emerging in the digital marketing space, to discuss how Amazon's Alexa is disrupting things, and to keep a close eye on the Snapchat IPO that was happening down the street. After recovering from a full-on week of excitement and learning, I’m eager to highlight my top four takeaways from the Social Media Week NYC event:
<h4><strong>1. Organic Is Only for Your Food.</strong></h4>
With the advent of Facebook’s News Feed and everyone else in the social space following suit, the chronological-style update is dead to users. Thousands of elements are factored in when you log in to any of your social media profiles, and some of those elements include paid posts.

For companies looking to drive awareness, engagement or conversions, social media is now a pay-to-play game, but you must play it smart. Clicking a ""boost"" button next to a post is the equivalent of buying the travel-size bottle of aspirin next to the register versus walking back to the medicine aisle and getting a better deal. Sure, it's convenient and will get you a quick fix, but you can really stretch your dollars and layer in better audience targeting by spending the time planning out a buy.

An MTV panelist at Social Media Week NYC admitted that most posts that went viral had some kind of paid element. Whether it was at the start of the post or at a certain viewership level, there was a paid tactic to help grow the viewership and awareness.
<h4><strong>2. Snapchat! Snapchat! Snapchat!</strong></h4>
Snap Inc. actually went public while we were at Social Media Week NYC, and it's all anyone wanted to talk about. There were varying degrees of love (and hate) for the ghost icon, but there was no denying how much attention a face swap could get you. Our COO Jay Friedman even got in on the conversation last week, sharing with AdExchanger why he thinks <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/snapchats-ipo-like-twitter-2-0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Snapchat’s IPO is more like Twitter 2.0</a>.

Snap is now seeing its biggest growth with Gen Xers . . . . you know, the parents of those teenagers who have been snapping for years now. Despite the polarization of the platform, it's the most ""enjoyable communication technology,"" according to Adaptly and just recently opened up its advertising platform to the masses.

Snapchat is so popular that Facebook seems to be adding very similar features to their suite of products, including Instagram Stories, which has a higher viewership than Snapchat despite its significantly shorter tenure in the space.
<h4><strong>3. Video Viewership Is Big. Like Really Big. Huge Even. </strong></h4>
YouTube's viewership continues to rise versus linear TV, which has flatlined. Long gone are the days when everyone sits down to watch a live broadcast together now that video content is so easily accessible on demand. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/rise-programmatic-tv-explained-5-graphics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Programmatic TV</a> has been on the rise and will be for years to come.

One billion (with a b!) hours are consumed daily on YouTube, and Snapchat sees more than 10 billion video views per day. Facebook just released new features that will only increase viewership — like bigger video displays and auto-sound — and continues to promote its Live feature. Advertising on Facebook Live is still in a closed beta test, but we all know that this paid social advertising trend will catch on and will be opening up to marketers very soon.

Even though video viewership is up, attention spans are down. The average video view length on YouTube is 5 seconds, Snapchat 3.4 seconds and Facebook  3 seconds. Apparently, a goldfish has a 12-second attention span, making humans more distracted than a goldfish. Who knew? Well, now you know you’ll need to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/top-3-tips-programmatic-video-advertising-2017/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">optimize your videos</a> for shorter view times.
<h4><strong>4. The Bots Are Coming! </strong></h4>
As messenger apps are becoming more popular, social platforms are finding ways to create that one-to-one user interaction. From Amazon's Alexa to chatbots, companies are finding ways to create a more personalized and automatic response to their users’ needs. This artificial intelligence is changing how companies communicate with their users and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/ask-the-expert-what-does-alexa-mean-for-programmatic-advertisers-and-marketers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">has implications for how advertisers can monetize this new conversant channel</a>.

There still is a lot in development in the chatbot arena, and this will be a big year full of releases and updates for the space; for example, Alexa already has more than 10,000 skills, up from the 1,000 it had last summer.

You’ve spent hours crafting the perfect pitch deck for your client, and now it’s your big moment to deliver. Then come the dreaded questions from their old-school CEO, “<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/programmatic-101-how-to-reach-todays-consumers-with-programmatic/"">What is programmatic advertising?</a> Why should I spend money on it? Can’t we just keeping buying from the sites we know?” It’s like you hadn’t even presented in the first place – clearly, this CEO needs to be enrolled in programmatic 101.

We’ve all been there. It’s tough to explain a technical concept like programmatic to a client from the newspaper-and-TV-only era or who still buys digital media through an ad network. Before you dive into the jargon around demand-side platforms and their eyes glaze over, try a different approach and teach them about programmatic visually.

In less than three minutes, you’ll finally have the answer to your client’s eternal question, “What is programmatic advertising?” Check out our latest video for an easy-to-understand programmatic primer: how it works and why it should be part of every advertiser’s media mix:

One of the most unproductive times of the year for employers is also one of the biggest opportunities for advertisers — March Madness! Last year, consumers filled out <a href=""https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2697846-march-madness-2017-70-million-brackets-104-billion-in-bets-expected"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">more than 70 million</a> brackets during the tournament. This means millions of potential eyeballs for advertisers to target in those action-packed buzzer-beater moments.

Luckily, building the right digital advertising plan isn’t as complicated as picking the perfect bracket. We’ll help you play the odds with a high-scoring March Madness advertising strategy:

<ol start=""1"">
 	<li><strong>Combine cross-device targeting and people-based marketing for an unstoppable duo</strong>.
Getting in front of viewers won’t be difficult for advertisers since fans will be doing everything they can to catch the games. And thanks to live streaming, they can cheer on their alma maters not only at home but also during work hours. Streaming services, like CBS All Access, let them watch throughout the day on their computers, phones and tablets – making <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/tips-programmatic-video-advertising-2017/"">cross-device targeting</a> a must for your March Madness advertising strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">However, with this increased accessibility comes the need for ad personalization. Consumers expect advertisers to understand their needs and interests. Bombarding them with the same generic message over and over again is a surefire way to cause an upset (especially when it’s a retargeting ad that promotes a product they have already purchased – who’s with me!?). Instead, utilize <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-people-based-marketing/"">people-based marketing</a> techniques to share hyper-relevant messages with your consumers.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
 	<li><strong>Make your marketing small-screen-friendly</strong>.
According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">eMarketer</a>, almost half of 18- to 24-year-olds (younger millennials) keep up with March Madness via their mobile devices. When they aren’t able to watch the games live, they will at least be checking the scores and snapping their bracket standings on <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/takeaways-emarketers-digital-trends-2017/"">mobile messaging apps</a>. In fact, messaging app users will top almost 150 million this year thanks to millennial engagement. This obsession equates to tremendous potential reach for advertisers who want to engage a younger demographic during March Madness.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Start your March Madness advertising strategy by making sure all of your landing pages are small-screen-friendly to ensure successful conversions post-click. But don’t take on a “set it and forget it” attitude. Since users will tune in to all things related to the tournament on their phones as much as their TVs, consider other sharable approaches to grab their attention, for example, dynamic ads with GIF highlights of their favorite teams through custom affinity targeting.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
 	<li><strong>Capitalize on cord-cutters during prime time with advanced TV ads</strong>.
Cord-cutting is on the rise, but that doesn’t mean these viewers don’t want in on the action during prime time. Smart TVs enable those not using linear television — cable, satellite or broadcast — to stream national prime-time events, like March Madness. One of the beauties of advanced TV is you can supplement your existing TV buy with <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-questions-to-ask-before-buying-advanced-tv/"">advanced TV tactics</a> to ensure your ads aren’t missing anyone.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Advanced TV ads give you access to cord-cutter and cord-never audiences at both the national and local level. Use this digital video medium to engage a large audience with high-impact, highly visible units. Also, take advantage of advanced TV’s targeting capabilities by layering in basic targeting parameters to reach your most desirable potential customers.</p>

<ol start=""4"">
 	<li><strong>Play for the long game with paid social ads</strong>.
The inherent communal nature of sports make social media platforms a natural fit for digital advertising plans set to launch during March Madness season. Fans will be tweeting, posting, snapping, gloating, shaming and complaining to their friends on social media before, during and after the games. With <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/social-advertising-trends-social-media-week/"">paid social advertising</a>, you can target users based on their demographics, locations, interests, behaviors, connections and more.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Take advantage of trending social platforms, such as Snapchat, for a more creative outlet to reach younger viewers. And lucky for marketers, <a href=""https://marketingland.com/snapchat-opens-advertising-api-everyone-234429"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Snapchat recently opened up their programmatic advertising API</a> to all advertisers, for more streamlined buying.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Remember, getting the most mileage out of a social ad campaign also requires thoughtful groundwork well before tip-off. Brands who pre-promote their campaigns through social media contests and events can drive future value by placing tags to retarget users who visited their landing pages with specialty ads during the live event.</p>

 	<li><strong>Bonus time! Focus your game plan to score big</strong>.
There are basketball-obsessed fans who wouldn’t dare miss a game or highlight. Then, there are also those who typically couldn’t care less about sports, but the excitement of March Madness catches their attention for a couple of weeks. With more than 40 million people filling out at least one bracket this year, it’s easy to see who the target audience is for advertisers: everyone.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">However, just because the excitement creates new opportunities to get in front of a large and coveted audience doesn’t mean you should move forward with every single tactic. Remember, quality over quantity always wins (unless you’re counting the number of times a basketball goes into the net, of course).</p>

No matter what title they have, women in tech industries are typically surrounded by men. However, that male-dominated culture simply doesn’t exist at Goodway Group. <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/02/01/goodway-group-bucks-the-bro-culture-tech"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Our company is 75% female</a>, which also means we have lots of working moms in tech and leadership roles at Goodway.

Since March is Women’s History Month, we wanted to shed some light on the lives of our full-time professional women (<em>and full-time moms</em>). To celebrate, we recently reached out to some of the most amazing working moms we know in ad tech to share their personal stories and advice for achieving the best of both worlds:

<strong>What’s your motto as a working mom? </strong>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">My motto is that I have two jobs, and I must be equally dedicated to both — work hard at work and work hard at being the best mom I can be. Goodway allows me to succeed at both!</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 150px;"">- <em>Robin K., Sales Business Manager (and wrangler of her 10-year-old son, nephew and parents)</em></p>
<strong>What impact has working virtually for Goodway Group had on your life as a parent?</strong>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">I'm married to a pilot who has a crazy schedule. Many times, he is outside of the country, and I can't contact him, which leaves me in single-parent mode. Working from home allows me to avoid the commute time and being away from home while my husband is out of town. Another one of my favorite aspects of working from home is the ability to have breakfast as a family every morning. We make omelets, eggs and bacon, pancakes . . . . you name it; we have time for it! Our mornings are less stressful than they used to be because we have this time together.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">         - <em>Sarah M., Director of Ad Operations and Creative Services (and mom of four)</em></p>
<strong>What's the greatest lesson your mom shared that has helped you succeed as a professional? </strong>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">My mom taught me early on that just because I am a woman, it didn't mean I couldn't do anything I set my mind to. I come from a long line of strong, independent women. That has helped me to work in industries where women were scarce (auto parts, construction, IT).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">         - <em>Katie S., Client Coordinator (and mother to a middle schooler)</em></p>
<strong>What advice would you give to the next generation of women in tech who have big dreams?</strong>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">I would say be you and no one else. Tap into what makes you unique because being your true and authentic self will always pave the way for success. We're all born with innate gifts and abilities — somewhere among them, we find our purpose.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 120px;"">         - <em>Amber J., Training Supervisor (and one of Goodway’s newest parents after the birth of her daughter last year)</em></p>
<strong>How would you describe Goodway Group (in a Tweet)?</strong>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">A company that truly cares. About its clients, about its employees, about making this world a better place one day at a time. #goodwaygrouprocks</p>

Last month, thousands of social media professionals traveled to San Diego to participate in <a href=""https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/smmworld/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Social Media Marketing World</a>, arguably the largest social media conference in the country.

Hundreds of sessions at Social Media Marketing World were held ranging from creative content ideas to strategy sessions to emerging channels, but there was one topic that dominated the entire conference – paid social advertising trends.
<h4>You Must Pay to Play</h4>
As mentioned during <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/new-paid-social-advertising-trends-social-media-week-nyc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Social Media Week in New York</a>, chronological Newsfeeds no longer exist. With thousands of factors determining post placement, one thing is for sure, organic posts need a lot more help than before to get viewability from their audience.

One way to find that audience is through new paid social advertising trends. By strategically planning your objective and identifying your core audience, you can create a paid social media plan that delivers the right message to the right user, but make sure the content is worthwhile.
<h4>Content + Paid = Winning!</h4>
As marketers find new ways to buck the Newsfeed algorithms, there is a common misconception – the more you post, the more likely people are to see your message. Quantity is not the answer. Think about your own personal usage. What kind of posts get you to stop scrolling?

With Newsfeed inventory becoming limited and additional ad spaces becoming available, content has never been more important to capture the attention of users. Throw in some strategic advertising dollars and planning, and you’ve got yourself a winning combination to add to your paid social advertising trends.
<h4>Instagram is Copying Features . . . And Succeeding</h4>
Instagram has seen tremendous growth in the past year and continues to add in new features and offerings to compete with other platforms. One in every four users are active on Instagram Stories, aka what <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/snapchats-ipo-like-twitter-2-0/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Snapchat</a> does, resulting in more than 150 million users and counting. Instagram has also added in shoppable tags that echo some Pinterest features.

Instagram also has been kind to marketers, as 54 percent advertise on Instagram, up 11 points from last year. Seven in every ten marketers want to learn more about paid social advertising trends on the photo platform as it shifts from sharing heavily filtered pictures of your food to driving you to buy that food.
<h4>Social Media is Cross-Departmental</h4>
Long gone are the days when successful companies left social media to their marketing department. With the rapid growth of each platform and the two-way street of communication, social media is no longer an afterthought. Social media jobs are becoming more granular and less general as there are multiple functions needed to run successful campaigns.

A panel of executives from Dell, MGM Resorts International and ForRent.com all shared at Social Media Marketing World that when staffing social media positions, they are broken out into two different functions: roles that focus on content and branding and roles that focus on the digital or paid strategy. Successful companies are growing their social media footprint and staffing it with folks who have different market experiences as they all work together.

Social media is the fastest changing industry, where platforms roll out new features on what feels like a weekly basis. At Goodway, we’re staying on top of the evolving paid social advertising trends and landscape and have found that paid social media is an essential part of running a holistic digital campaign.

Transforming your TV strategy is a must to survive in today’s new normal. While cord-cutting was expected to grow significantly in the coming years, no one could’ve predicted the surge that resulted from coronavirus (COVID-19). According to recent research from market research company GlobalWebIndex, 37% of consumers are watching more streaming TV since the outbreak started, and two-thirds of those streaming are planning to continue the habit. To be where your audience watches and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmlY26oFM8U"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">to reach more customers who matter to you</a>, now's the time to move beyond linear TV and add advanced TV to your client’s media mix. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/contact/"">We can help</a>. Download our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/advanced-tv-bother-guide/"">newly updated free Advanced TV Guide</a> and quickly get the buzzwords, capabilities, spending trends and strategies you need to buy advanced TV. But first, what is advanced TV and the types available? Let's learn all the definitions you need to know to activate a modern TV strategy during COVID-19 and beyond:

<strong>What Is Advanced TV?</strong>

<span style=""color: #000000;"">This is the umbrella term that refers to several forms of streaming TV content, including connected TV, TV everywhere, video on demand (VOD) and programmatic TV. It's the <a href=""https://www.iab.com/news/advanced-tv-targeting-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IAB’s catchall term</a> for all forms of TV not watched through a broadcast, cable or satellite connection on a television.</span>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Connected TV</strong> <span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">– Ads that are served via over-the-top devices, smart TV apps and gaming consoles make this the most evolved inventory in the advanced TV ecosystem. It's <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-steps-capturing-retail-traffic-connected-tv"">a great fit for any advertiser</a>, given its broad reach and audience targeting capabilities.</span></span></span></li>
 	<li><strong>TV Everywhere</strong> – TV everywhere's focus on login-required streaming apps created by TV networks means its audience tends to skew younger. It's a good tactic for advertisers with click or activity goals since tracking is available on cookie-enabled devices.</li>
 	<li><strong>Video on Demand (VOD)</strong> – VOD ads are shown on a cable or satellite provider's app when a consumer chooses to watch a show that previously aired. These ads complement your linear TV buy and extend your reach to audiences who might otherwise miss your message.</li>
 	<li><strong>Programmatic TV</strong> <span style=""color: #000000;"">– Buy linear TV ads programmatically and serve them during live programming. With the largest scale, programmatic TV is perfect for brand awareness campaigns seeking national exposure. (Programmatic TV is also referred to as addressable linear if addressable targeting is layered onto the ad.)</span></li>
</ul>
Now that you’re well-versed in all the different types of advanced TV, you need to ask yourself if <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-questions-to-ask-before-buying-advanced-tv/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">advanced TV is right for your clients' campaigns</a>. What if your clients are on the fence and need to be convinced? We’ve got you covered with our professionally designed <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/advanced-tv-stat-pack-slides/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">advanced TV slides</a>. This stat pack, newly updated in response to COVID-19, covers data on advanced TV’s audience and growth and the reasons why advanced TV should be part of your client’s media strategy.

Chances are you’ve streamed shows this week, whether it’s been to keep the kids busy or to stave off your own boredom while staying at home during the pandemic. As a consumer and an advertiser, this should tell you it’s simply not enough these days to reach consumers only through traditional linear TV. To <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmlY26oFM8U"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">reach all the customers who matter to you</a>, consider buying advanced TV, especially now that the living room is any device and household screens these days are getting more attention than ever.

However, though advanced TV can help you maximize your audience reach to show more value for every dollar you spend, it isn’t right for every advertiser. Familiarize yourself with <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"">all the advanced TV definitions you need to know</a> and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/advanced-tv-stat-pack-slides/"">download our newly updated advanced TV slides</a> for the latest trends, data and rationales on why you should include advanced TV in your campaigns. Then ask yourself these five quick questions to help you determine if buying advanced TV is right for you:
<ol start=""1"">
 	<li>
<h4>How much budget do I have?</h4>
</li>
</ol>
Connected TV works well for smaller budgets since it adds over-the-top (OTT) devices and smart TVs to a DSP buy. You could run a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-steps-capturing-retail-traffic-connected-tv"">connected TV campaign</a> with a monthly budget as little as $5,000, although we typically recommend a higher spend so your dollars aren’t spread too thin. If you have more to spend, you can consider video on demand or <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/rise-programmatic-tv-explained-5-graphics/"">programmatic TV</a>, which often commands minimums of $15,000 per month.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h4>Where is my campaign running?</h4>
</li>
</ol>
Geography is another factor to take into consideration with advanced TV. Advanced TV is still a growing market, and scale is a challenge for smaller geos. Connected TV can work for smaller geos, but be prepared to shift your budget to other tactics if scale is an issue. Sticking to pre-roll video might be a better fit for granulary targeted campaigns. If you're advertising nationally or in one of the larger DMAs, there should be plenty of inventory available via video on demand (VOD) and programmatic TV.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h4>Is my creative digital-friendly?</h4>
</li>
</ol>
While some advertisers find success with repurposing a :15 or :30 TV spot online, your campaign will probably be more successful with a creative designed for the online experience. Platforms like YouTube allow audiences to skip ads, so if you don’t hook a user within the first 5 seconds, you risk your ad getting skipped. Additionally, many users are streaming advanced TV on tablets and phones. If your creative isn’t designed with a small screen in mind, your video could look too busy on these devices.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>
<h4>What are my campaign goals?</h4>
</li>
</ol>
Advanced TV is still primarily an awareness builder rather than a direct-response tactic, though advanced TV attribution is in place and getting more advanced all the time. You can benefit from your media being trackable across all devices, and you can see post-view activities attributed to connected TV media, but these activities are harder to track than other inventory types. In the near future, some advertisers will be tracking offline in-store sales too. For example, <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/352336/shopper-marketing-marries-ott-roku-adds-kroger-da.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Roku and Kroger just teamed up to track specific CPG purchases</a>. But if you’re looking to run a VOD or programmatic TV campaign, awareness and viewability goals are your best bet. Viewability is high on these types of campaigns since the audience is highly engaged and sometimes can’t skip the commercials.
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li>
<h4>How does advanced TV fit in with my linear TV buy?</h4>
</li>
</ol>
One of the beauties of advanced TV is that you can mirror a traditional TV schedule and reach users across all their devices on the same programs. Cord-cutters and cord-nevers are on the rise as consumers are demanding more control over their viewing experience, and while traditional TV won’t entirely disappear, its audience is starting to shrink. Supplementing an existing TV buy with a portion of budget carved out for advanced TV tactics will ensure your ads aren’t missing anyone.

How often do you use your phone or tablet throughout the day for more than calls, texts or surfing the internet? Chances are, you've already used it to access at least one mobile app today — whether it was checking your coffee shop reward points while at the barista counter, finding directions to a client's office on the go or playing the latest version of Candy Crush Saga from your couch.

With <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"">over 2.75 billion* apps downloaded</a> to tablets and mobile phones to date, it should come as no surprise that people spend an <a href=""https://informatemi.com/blog/?p=133"">average of 4.7 hours per day**</a> with them. Yet, even as apps become an integral part of our daily lives, marketers are challenged with finding the right mobile app strategy for identifying and acquiring new users in those ""I want to know,"" ""where do I go"" and ""how do I buy"" moments. In today's flooded app market, how can marketers really drive app discovery, motivate users to download and maintain user engagement?
<h4>Don't Roll the Dice on Your App</h4>
As app stores become increasingly crowded, it's more important than ever for marketers to cut through the noise and win consumer attention. Go the distance to understand the full life cycle of your app users, from how they found you to installation to how often they log in. Building the right mobile app strategy to keep them coming back starts here.

<strong>Getting Started &amp; Set Up:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Does your app offer functions beyond those already on your website?</li>
 	<li>Is it useful for a wide range of users?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Rules of Play:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Are you leveraging a search or programmatic ad campaign?</li>
 	<li>Is your Software Development Kit (SDK) tracking integrated with your ad campaign?</li>
 	<li>Are you using a CPM pricing model?</li>
</ul>
<strong>How to Win:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Does your app simplify your users' lives?</li>
 	<li>Have users continued to log into your app over and over again?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Goodway Group Expert Tips</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Remember, the right <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/digital-advertising-strategy-is-costing-you/"">digital advertising strategy</a> may complement your offline specials, drive ecommerce and build brand loyalty more effectively than an app.</li>
 	<li>Measuring ad clicks that only deliver users to the app store doesn't mean an install actually happened. We recommend using properly integrated SDKs to optimize toward actual app opens or an in-app action, like a confirmed login, purchase or other downstream event.</li>
 	<li>A re-engagement ad campaign can find those users who haven't opened the app in 90 days, help remind them why your app makes their life easier and get them back to using it regularly with a unique incentive campaign, such as a discount toward a purchase, exclusive deal or bonus content.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Stuck in the Setup Phase?</h4>
It might be time to rethink your app's value proposition. Rather than an app, consider using your website, email-nurturing campaigns, <a href=""https://infinitee.com/2016/08/connecting-cyber-footprint-stores-foot-traffic-part-1/"">in-store experiences</a> or social promotions to target specific users in limited locations.
<h4>Don't forget to follow the rules, or you might lose a turn!</h4>
Advance to the corner of acumen and ingenuity — it's time to take advantage of your audience insights to further expand your user base with a best-in-class mobile app strategy. Start by boosting your app's visibility and targeting users with ads while they are doing other things on their smartphones. Be there when they are on the move and looking for you with targeted banner ads and search campaigns that drive app awareness and downloads. But be cautious of those trying to trade an ultralow cost-per-install (CPI) for higher app store rankings. CPI campaigns often bring in low-quality traffic with extra incentives, like free in-game rewards, but once the incentive is paid out, users quickly delete the app.
<h4>Are Others Landing on your Mobile Real Estate Over and Over Again?</h4>
Victory is yours! You're well on your way to a successful mobile app strategy. Remember, it's pretty common for users to abandon or delete an app over time. According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"">eMarketer</a>, app retention drops to 6% after just 30 days.*** Ensure your app serves a specific purpose and provides value well past the initial download.

Just like the new kid in school, when display ads stepped into the marketing arena, many were skeptical. After more than a decade in the market, display ads have grown out of that awkward phase and are way cooler than you ever thought. Download our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/debunking-display-ad-myths-stat-pack-slides"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ad stat pack slides</a> for the instant research you need to debunk display ad myths and explain why online banners should be in every client’s media plan.
<h4>Banner Ads Play Nice with Everyone</h4>
Remember that kid in high school who — even though he wasn’t technically in the popular group — seemed to be friends with everyone? In digital marketing, that’s <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/capabilities/programmatic-media/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">display advertising</a>.

Without being too boastful or pushy, display has a clever way of allowing us to test, discover and solve the biggest challenges in digital marketing. For example, it enables marketers to test applications and translations of first-party data at scale through identity resolution products. These tests determine the best partners, verify match rates and inform all, ensuing decisions about how to use CRM data in the future to maximize ROI across all channels. What’s more, display isn’t looking to kill the curve. The lessons learned from banner tests can be applied to many other ad channels and mediums so everyone makes the grade.
<h4>Those Thick Glasses Are for More Than Seeing the Blackboard</h4>
There was once a time when thick glasses were a sign of corrected vision — and that you were sure to get your lunch money stolen. Today, these are more common on a fashion-forward hipster. Display is like said frames, giving the advertiser clear sight into both the micro and macro levels of digital campaigns.

On the micro side, display advertising is where our programmatic traders scale and learn what’s working to drive KPIs, and what’s not within a campaign’s current parameters. It provides the most efficient path to understanding <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/maximizing-your-q4-budget/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">dayparting, device usage, audience geography, third-party data and more</a>, which can be critical to how marketers position usage across other mediums. From the macro view, we can spot larger <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/paid-social-advertising-trends-social-media-marketing-world/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">industry trends</a>, <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/288141/does-wpps-triad-acquisition-cross-marketing-churc.html?edition=97730"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">mergers and acquisitions</a> and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/ask-the-expert-what-does-alexa-mean-for-programmatic-advertisers-and-marketers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">new products</a> on the horizon because of technology evolutions that are catalyzed through banner ads.
<h4>Why Display Stands Up to Bullies</h4>
Unlike other channels, display impressions provide the scale necessary to deliver and test site quality. With plenty of data available to shine a spotlight on possible bad apples, like fake news sites, and a gang of verification providers on your side, display can cost-effectively ensure advertisers are able to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/emarketer-turns-jay-friedman-discuss-ad-tech-fraud-u-s/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">avoid potential fraudsters</a>. This is also where private marketplaces and big data will meet to take down header-bidding bullies. As with past changes in RTB structure and pricing theory tests, the latest advances often start with online banners before filtering through to other inventory types.

Let’s face it, display shouldn’t be your only friend in the digital space, but it should be one of your closest. Sure, online banners can seem a little geeky, but they’re smart in a suspenders-and-bow-tie kind of way. And we can’t do without them just yet … here’s <a href=""https://www.imediaconnection.com/article/229992/160420-jay-friedman-5-reasons-the-banner-ad-isnt-ready-to-die"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">five more reasons the banner ad isn't ready to die</a>.

At the heart of Goodway is our people. And where there are people, there are inevitably special interests, passions and unique hobbies. Since April is National Volunteer Month, we wanted to share how giving back makes a difference by spotlighting some of the amazing corporate giving and volunteer programs Goodway offers to our employees and our community.

Encouraging our employees to give back to those in need has been a part of the Goodway culture for over half a century. Our current corporate giving initiatives all started with the Milton Wolk Foundation created by Goodway’s founder in 1965, which supported a variety of charities. Then, as the leadership torch passed on to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/about/history/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Beryl Wolk</a>, “A Better World” was established in 1990 as part of our ongoing pursuit to support not-for-profits, social causes, start-ups, entrepreneurs and those in need on a national and global basis.

Since then, our current president, Dave Wolk, has continued to cultivate that dream across the many communities our employees touch. So, it comes as no surprise that over the years, many of our employees have demonstrated compassion by personally volunteering at charity events, serving on nonprofit boards or donating their talents to organizations in their area.

Still in recent years, we asked how we could do more to support this vision for stronger, healthier communities where we live and work through our official corporate giving programs. Inspired by the memory of Milton’s and Beryl’s unwavering commitment, we launched the expansion of Goodway Cares in 2016 to provide new ways for our team members to do good in every aspect of their lives.

The key components of our Goodway Cares program are two-fold. First, we established Goodway Cares as a 501c3 charity that our employees can easily donate to through payroll deductions. These Goodway Cares funds are typically used to place ads supporting events and causes for worthwhile non-profit organizations across the country. Goodway matches these contributions up to $250 annually per employee.

But we know passions come in all shapes and sizes, and our employees care about a wide range of social causes. Some love donating toys to shelter dogs, while others like to pick out the paint for murals in their city park. And if socializing with seniors is their thing, that’s great too! Goodway Cares makes it easy for our employees to choose the cause they are most passionate about. That’s why they can also opt to give money to a charity of their choice. As an added bonus, Goodway will also match these donations up to $250 annually per employee.

The second part of our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/about/goodway-cares/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Goodway Cares</a> program is an in-kind donation of our services and expertise to organizations in need. As a successful, family-owned business, we understand the challenges of starting an organization from nothing. That’s why we let a dedicated group of our employees lend their skills, time and talents to help budding non-profits with everything from how to implement agile processes, to effectively managing remote workforces to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/capabilities/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">digital media</a> training.

How has giving back through Goodway Cares made a difference in our communities? Here are just a handful of the 100+ organizations that have been impacted by Goodway Cares match and corporate giving programs in the past year:

According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Article/eMarketer-Releases-New-Programmatic-Advertising-Estimates/1015682?ecid=NL1001"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer’s latest estimates</a>, programmatic is on the rise with digital display advertising spending in the United States expected to come in at 32.56 billion, 78% of total digital display ad dollars in 2017 and then swell to 84% of the pie by 2019. More advertisers are becoming familiar with programmatic advertising and seeing its benefits, so how do you stay knowledgeable and stay ahead of the competition? Put your first-party data first.

This is precisely what Goodway Group COO Jay Friedman recommends in this excerpt from eMarketer’s recently released report, “Advancing Programmatic Advertising: Buyers and Sellers Seek Greater Control Over Ad Campaigns and Audiences Reached”:

“For 2017, what we’re pushing marketers toward is thinking about first-party data first,” said Jay Friedman, partner and COO at programmatic media buying and planning firm Goodway Group. “Starting with the question, ‘What data do I have?’ and then how do they use it and model it to create their own universe. From there, we’re asking them to focus on better identity management, which involves cross-device management and tying it to your first-party data.”
<h3><strong>First-Party Data: What Is it?</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>This is data you already own.
<ul>
 	<li>It’s free, it’s accurate and it’s safe. It’s all the valuable information you’ve collected about your audience – your customers and prospects – such as contact info, behaviors, past actions and purchase history, from the following sources:
<ul>
 	<li>your website</li>
 	<li>your customer relationship management (CRM)</li>
 	<li>your subscriptions</li>
 	<li>your mobile web and apps</li>
 	<li>your social media data</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>First-Party Data: How Can It Benefit You?</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>First-party data is effective because it can automatically tell you who your “perfect fit” customers and prospects are.
<ul>
 	<li>Since you already know who is interacting with your brand, what type of person is interested in or using your product or service, it takes the guesswork out of targeting.
<ul>
 	<li>Instead of simply hoping you pick the right third-party segments, you can build look-alike models from your first-party data to accurately scale and extend your audience.</li>
 	<li>You can segment your first-party data based on your unique business needs instead of relying on “off the shelf” third-party segments, which could end up being too broad and generic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>First-Party Data: How Can It Help You Succeed?</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>When you use your first-party data to the fullest and then connect it to second-party data (just first-party data from another source) or any third-party data (aggregated data from an outside source), then you can see your audience holistically, from all angles.</li>
 	<li>Data – owning, connecting and understanding it – is how you better connect with your target audience and win today.
<ul>
 	<li>It can help you run programmatic advertising campaigns more efficiently and effectively and with greater success.</li>
 	<li>It can help you get to know your target audience better so you can more precisely target, personalize messaging and foster deeper relationships with current and potential customers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4>How does your agency define advanced TV? And do you consider it the same as connected TV or programmatic TV?</h4>
We <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">define advanced TV</a> as any platform that digitally transmits TV content. The ability to digitally transmit has led to platforms offering consumers new ways to view TV content. We see connected TV as a subset of the advanced TV space, and we see programmatic TV as a buying approach to connect marketers to the inventory. We also see TV everywhere, video on demand and addressable TV as part of the overall non-linear TV conversation. The foundation of all these platforms is the ability to utilize data in these environments.
<h4>What are the main similarities and differences between buying advanced TV and buying traditional TV?</h4>
With traditional TV, the buying processes have been established for many years and still involve direct communication between the publisher (national networks or local TV stations) and the agency. Advanced TV, on the other hand, does not have established processes. We don’t see uniformity in how our partners are approaching this space. If the product more closely aligns with the digital world (i.e., connected TV), the processes mirror that. If the product is closer to the linear TV world (i.e., video-on-demand), the processes work more similarly to traditional TV buying.
<h4>Are there any special considerations when developing creative assets for advanced TV?</h4>
Most of the partners we work with want to make the process seamless as they are competing for linear TV dollars, even using the same length (primarily :30's and :15's). With that said, there are considerations as the creative moves into a digital environment. For example, does the ad have a more direct call-to-action and now requires the ability to click and pixel the creative to track post-impression/click activity?
<h4>What are some of the main challenges your agency has experienced in figuring out the best way to buy advanced TV?</h4>
We have challenges in a few key areas, which mostly relate back to how new the space is:
<ul>
 	<li>Our first challenge is education/understanding of the space. Because this space is constantly evolving and our partners are learning it at the same time, it is hard to keep an accurate pulse on the information. The space lacks standardization in reporting, tracking and even how the media partners are cataloging the different tactics.</li>
 	<li>The second challenge is the platforms themselves. We all understand conceptually that the consumer is watching TV in new ways. However, are the platforms vetted for the shift of dollars from traditional TV? Is there enough scale, especially on the local level to make it worth our while?</li>
 	<li>Lastly, we are creating new processes (or merging existing ones) to integrate this into our current media plans and buys.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How would you describe the characteristics of an advertiser who is a good fit for advanced TV?</h4>
The most obvious <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-questions-to-ask-before-buying-advanced-tv/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">characteristic of an advertiser</a> is that video is a key component of their media plan. Naturally, these emerging platforms are great complements and extensions of existing activity.

Other characteristics would include:
<ul>
 	<li>They have a video-first approach.</li>
 	<li>They have a more defined audience.</li>
 	<li>They have a younger audience.</li>
 	<li>They want to be on the forefront and have a “test and learn” mindset.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can you describe a successful case study you’ve seen with an advertiser who has run advanced TV?</h4>
Our advanced TV campaigns have been part of an overall integrated video campaign including traditional TV and pre-roll, so it’s difficult to isolate the overall impact.

With that said, we do have multiple clients who have integrated it into their 2017 plans. Dickies, as an example, is a national brand of ours that was already spending in national cable and digital video. A natural progression for them in 2017 is closing the gap by incorporating connected TV (Roku and Apple TV), TV everywhere (ESPN), video on demand (Comcast) and addressable TV through specific cable networks. Their activity begins in Q3/Q4, so we’ll have a better understanding of the overall impact to sales.
<h4>Any final pieces of advice for agencies getting ready to pitch advanced TV for the first time?</h4>
I would go back to the comment on <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/advanced-tv-bother-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">education</a>. It’s key for the agency to invest time in learning and understanding the space but also taking the client along for the ride.

A little over a month ago, <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-fcc-privacy-rules-repeal-explained-2017-4/#so-in-many-ways-this-whole-thing-was-a-question-of-default-settings-8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">our government passed a law that rolled back proposed consumer privacy rules for internet service providers</a>, or ISPs, essentially allowing ISP data tracking. Everyone in our industry has an opinion on what this means for them, including consumers, advertisers, publishers and the ISPs themselves. Here's a roundup on the implications of the ruling for all the players.
<h4>Why is ISP data tracking allowed?</h4>
The rules proposed by the FCC are related to, but separate from the net neutrality decision made in 2015. In a nutshell, reclassifying ISPs to comply with net neutrality opened a loophole for consumer data protection. The proposed rules, developed during the Obama administration but not set to go into effect until December this year, would have required your opt-in to give permission for your data to be used for advertising. The rollback allows ISPs to continue to use or sell your data as they wish, unless you actively opt out, which is a more involved process than being asked to opt in.
<h4>Internet Service Providers – A Seat at the Table</h4>
Three of the largest ISPs have claimed they <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2017/04/04/isps-can-now-collect-and-sell-your-data-what-know-internet-privacy/100015356/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">do not have plans to sell consumer data to third parties</a>. However, even if they keep this promise not to sell data, they can certainly use it themselves to offer more robust advertising opportunities than they have previously. Some industry insiders think that ISPs are looking to <a href=""https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/how-isps-can-sell-your-web-history-and-how-to-stop-them/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">rival Facebook and Google and increase their profits through creating cross-device advertising packages</a>. After all, your ISP knows every single website you visit on every device, and if they are also your cable provider, they know every show you are watching. Some take this a step further and think that <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/as-telecoms-buy-up-ad-tech-players-new-levels-of-data-targeting-seem-to-be-afoot/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ISPs are going to marry their data with ad tech acquisitions to create an entirely new business model</a>.
<h4>Publishers – Concerns Over Proprietary Data</h4>
Publishers haven't spoken out directly about the ruling, but some could be <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/the-sell-sider/isp-tracking-consumers-arent-ones-lose/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">worried that ISPs will steal their hard-earned proprietary data</a>. ISPs only see the top-level domain of secure sites, so they might know that you visit The New York Times website regularly, but they won't see which stories you read. However, this data could be enough to combine with other signals to put you in a ""reads newspapers online"" audience. The ISP could profit from the publisher's data without the publisher's involvement. However, as noted earlier, it seems more likely that ISPs will monetize this data through cross-device packages rather than sell third-party data.
<h4>Advertisers – Trade Groups Onboard, Advertisers Keeping Mum</h4>
Industry trade groups seem to be for the ruling, claiming that there will be more opportunities for relevant advertising. Both the Data &amp; Marketing Organization and Internet &amp; Television Association <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/marketing-groups-applaud-senate-vote-that-lets-isps-sell-consumer-data-without-consent/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">applauded the decision</a>. It's not surprising that trade groups would be in favor of more accessible consumer data. Individual advertisers and DSPs have yet to speak out publicly, perhaps because they are caught in the middle. They could be intrigued by new targeting opportunities available through ISP data tracking but might be hesitant to speak out since the legislation is so unpopular with consumer and privacy advocates.
<h4>Consumers – Worries About Invasion of Privacy</h4>
Finally, <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">consumers are concerned about invasions of privacy</a>. Not much has changed, but consumers don't like being reminded that their daily internet activity is for sale, especially since they are paying ISPs for their services. It's very different from the data-as-a-fee services that Google and Facebook provide. <a href=""https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/security/a25859/how-to-protect-your-online-privacy-from-isp/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Consumers can try to protect their data</a> through opting out of ISP data collection, using end-to-end encryption apps or setting up a virtual private network, or VPN. Each method has benefits and drawbacks, but the one thing they all have in common is that it is up to each user to protect their data.

At the end of the day, we're at the status quo since the proposed FCC rules never went into effect. We've yet to see major plays by ISPs to use this data, but that doesn't mean they aren't already taking advantage of it behind the scenes, or that they don't have plans in the works. This is a development that we'll keep our eye on, and we're interested to see how the ramifications of the law will affect our industry.

How often have you found yourself working late nights and stressed out at the beginning of the month, trying to create client reports for the previous month? Your client is asking for more than just the numbers, but after drowning in a sea of impressions, clicks and activities, you're completely cross-eyed and can't find any insights to share. If this scenario is all too familiar, we're here to help. One reason for this struggle might be that your digital campaign strategy wasn't set up for insights success.

In this blog post, you'll learn how to plan campaigns with the end goal of generating insights for your clients. Running digital campaigns is like running a science lab — there's a process that you need to follow to make the most of every campaign dollar.

To start, you need to identify two things — your unique business challenges and your audience. What is your unique business challenge? Are you trying to generate more leads through your website? Looking to increase sales? Launching a new product? Once you've identified your challenge, you need to identify the audience you want to reach. Are they current customers or new customers? Millennials or boomers? Male or female?

Combine your business challenge and audience to determine what type of campaign to run. Want to reach millennials and entice them to try out your product for the first time? <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/new-paid-social-advertising-trends-social-media-week-nyc/"">A social media campaign is probably a good fit</a>. Looking to reach customers that have actively researched competitor products? A search campaign would probably work well for you, along with a targeted display campaign focusing on in-market third-party data.

You're not out of the woods yet on strategy and planning. Once you know what type of campaign you are going to run, you need to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goal-prioritization-paramount-for-programmatic/"">pick a specific goal and determine how you are going to measure it</a>. If your goal is increasing website traffic by 25%, you should use a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/why-your-marketing-reports-dont-match/"">website analytics tool like Google Analytics to measure traffic over time</a>. If your goal is selling 500 units within six months, you should link your ecommerce data to your ad server so that you can connect your advertising results directly to your sales numbers. Whichever goal you pick, make sure that your reporting includes your goal metrics.

<strong>Scenario 1: Which day of the week is best to promote flash sales?</strong>
A retail advertiser wants to figure out which day of the week is best for flash-sale promotions. The retailer has guessed it's Friday but wants to be sure before moving more budget to Fridays. The advertiser builds out reporting that shows performance by day. After three weeks of comparing day-over-day reporting, the advertiser notices that Friday and Saturday have the best response rates, vastly outperforming the rest of the week. The retailer now knows with confidence that Friday and Saturday are the days to promote flash sales and spends more money on those days.

<strong>Scenario 2: Using A/B testing to evaluate a new audience.</strong>
A hotel chain's main demographic is business travelers age 35-50. However, it is starting to see increased bookings from the 25-35 age group. The chain would like to test which demographic is more responsive to online advertising. The campaign is set up in two sections —targeting ages 25-35 and ages 35-50. The rest of the campaign settings remain the same. Final reporting showed that the 25-35 age group had more online bookings, even though the older group still had more overall hotel stays. The hotel chain now knows they should continue to invest in digital advertising to a younger demographic to build out their overall customer base.

You've picked a variable to test, you've run your campaign, and now you need to analyze your results. Check your reporting and compare your goal metric for each variable that you tested. If you tested audience segments, compare each segment's performance against your goal. Often, one will clearly outperform the other. Occasionally the results will be close. If your test shows similar results for both variables, it means both are equally important to your campaign, and you can move on to testing a different variable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Once you've analyzed your results, make sure to apply these insights to your next campaign. If behavioral targeting did best, increase the budget for this tactic next time. If a younger audience was more responsive than an older audience, consider adding YouTube and Snapchat to your campaign, if you aren't running these platforms already. Uncovering your insights and continuing to apply them is an iterative process. Make sure that you are constantly testing and learning new things.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Also, don't forget the importance of retesting. Market conditions change throughout the year and from year to year. If a test six months ago indicated that iOS is outperforming Android, and you stopped targeting Android, retest to make sure this is still the case. Sometimes, what worked well in the past is no longer the best performer, and you could be missing out on new opportunities by not reconfirming whether or not your past insights still apply.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

<h4>How do you set up your client's digital campaign strategy for insights? Is it the same starting point for every client, or does it vary?</h4>
Since our overall planning process is strategically driven, we do our best to always set up our clients' campaigns for insights. First, we look at a client's goals and align those with the most effective channels to achieve success, whether the goal is upper funnel or lower funnel or awareness or direct response. However, within those goals there might live some unknowns such as, who is my audience, or is this the right creative message to present to the consumer? We compile a list of these questions, and then develop test-and-learn action plans or A/B testing to let the data guide us to the answers.

Most clients start with some idea of who their audience is, yet segment discovery is a big part of the digital insights process. It helps to start broad and then further dive into subsets. For example, if you are selling computers and you know that college students are your core audience, testing can extract insights around whether we should also target the parents who actually make the purchase. Other clients might find insights diving into site analytics, testing different calls to action or measuring in-store foot traffic.
<h4>What value do insights provide?</h4>
Insights should be able to provide actionable recommendations that move up the marketing chain. Once you assess the data from a digital campaign, it should be applicable elsewhere. You might start with digital, but the best value is an insight that has a ripple effect to out-of-home, print, TV and partnerships or sponsorships. Ultimately, when you can apply those learnings to your client's greater business, you can provide them ways to spend their budgets or run their business more efficiently. Digital has the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-ways-ai-marketing-will-revolutionize-ad-campaigns/"">advantage of rapid iteration</a> and gaining significant sample sizes quickly, which presents the ideal test bed for insights.
<h4>What successes have your clients seen with campaign insights?</h4>
A luxury car dealership was targeting golfers, a segment they had been marketing to for years. However, when we did a segment exploration, we found that the golfer group had a lower digital ROI than other audiences. The golfers were still important to the client, but needed to be valued differently because they are an expensive audience to go after. We refocused our budget on lower hanging fruit to find more users that were still highly qualified, yet less expensive to balance out the cost of the golfer audience. Believe it or not, we discovered that owners of this brand also enjoy going to comedy clubs. It came totally out of left field, but there was an observed significant correlation and impact. This was not what the dealership was expecting, but it ultimately became a successful new segment that they continue to target.
<h4>You CAN'T always bat .1000. What's your approach when an insight turns out to be false?</h4>
When you bubble up an insight, you are drawing from a trend with statistical significance, but it's not always guaranteed to be right. With an experimentation-first mindset, it's important to be OK with being wrong, because that's crucial feedback that tells you to pivot and try again. It's like Facebook's old mantra of ""moving fast and breaking things."" With digital, you have the advantage of being able to move fast and change rapidly if something isn't working. Agencies and advertisers need to be OK with their hypothesis being wrong since course-correcting is part of a digital campaign strategy. Perfection is the enemy of good — it's far better to be right only 80% of the time than not knowing what is working 80% of the time.
<h4>What are some common issues or blocks you see when agencies struggle to find campaign insights?</h4>
There are three main issues that I've seen several times:
<ul>
 	<li>The first is agencies or advertisers that aren't open to an experimentation mindset. They are steadfast in their conception of their audience and assume their audience never changes or develops new interests. It's important to be willing to try new things to gain insights.</li>
 	<li>The next issue is not including an active control in tests. Your control group must be running at the same time as an experimental group; otherwise, your conclusions won't be valid. If you compare test results to last month or last quarter, your performance could have been affected by seasonality or the news cycle, so it's like comparing apples to applesauce.</li>
 	<li>The final issue I encounter is agencies that act transactionally rather than strategically. An agency might say they want to spend $50K on a specific site or tactic because it's ""the thing to do,"" without thinking through why they want to run there. Will they learn something from that site? If we're just placing the media, we're simply providing measurement and attribution, and no learning will come from that.</li>
</ul>

It's an age-old problem for marketers: Your media platform reports show glowing results, but your client's site analytics data tells a conflicting story. Who's right? While the numbers don't lie, they aren't necessarily telling either of you the whole story. Before you apologize for a mistake you didn't actually make, get the real answer to why your marketing reports don't match.
<h4>Site Analytics versus Media Platform Reports</h4>
[table id=7 responsive=scroll responsive_breakpoint=phone /]
<h4>Every (Milli)second Counts: The Problem with Site Latency</h4>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-5824 size-full"" title=""Why Your Marketing Reports Don't Match (And Why They Never Will)"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hourglass-site-latency-chart.png"" alt=""hourglass graphic of how long users wait for a website to load"" width=""600"" height=""392"" />Most technical problems in reporting stem from when each system counts an interaction. A media platform report will note a viewable impression served when over 50% of an ad is onscreen for more than one second. And if the ad is clicked, the ad server will immediately register the action. However, site analytics won't count the action until the landing page fully loads.
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This disconnect in reporting time frames is a common problem for sites with a high latency, or long page load times. For example, when someone clicks your ad but bounces from your site before the page completely loads, your website tracking code may not register the visit. So your media reports show a click, but your site analytics do not.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For every second that you shave off your load time, you'll boost consumer engagement and the likelihood that your conversion numbers match up. But remember, latency isn't the only technical problem to watch out for. Cookie blockers, setup mistakes and other errors can also impact how different systems interpret whether or not an action took place.</p>

<h4>Out of Sight, (Not) Out of Mind: The Problem with Last-Click Attribution</h4>
Last-click attribution, also known as last-touch attribution, is when the last touch point in the customer's journey gets conversion credit. For example, if users see a display ad for a new bicycle, they might check out reviews on the company's Facebook page before clicking to the website to buy the bike. Since most site analytics platforms use a last-click model, Facebook would receive 100% conversion credit in their reports and the display ad would receive 0%, even though it was an important awareness touch point in the buyer's journey.

While this can be very appealing to bottom-of-the-funnel marketers, the flaw in this system is that it ignores all other touch points in the purchase path that influenced the user to make the buy. In today's media-saturated world, advertisers can't rely on clicks alone to accurately measure the impact of their ad campaigns.

It's the same concept in traditional advertising. No one expects a viewer to run out the door to buy their product immediately after watching a TV commercial. Advertisers know that just seeing the ad can drive brand awareness — <a href=""https://www.iab.com/insights/cross-media-ad-effectiveness-study/"">by as much as a 24% lift</a>, according to a recent study — and help nudge the consumer along in the conversion funnel for a later purchase.
<h4><img class=""aligncenter wp-image-5823 size-full"" style=""margin-bottom: 25px;"" title=""Why Your Marketing Reports Don't Match (and Why They Never Will)"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/digital-exposed-brand-lift-chart.png"" alt=""bar chart of digital exposed brand lift in awareness, familiarity and consideration "" width=""1000"" height=""404"" />Making a Good Impression: The Problem with Post-Impression Tracking</h4>
Post-impression tracking, also known as view-through tracking, attributes conversions to a given media channel well after the user saw the ad, even if the user didn't click the ad. Media platform reports typically include post-impression tracking, whereas site analytics reports never do. Even if you limit your media reports to only show post-click, they still may not match site analytics post-click data due to the latency and last-click issues already mentioned. This is another reason why your marketing reports don't match and will likely never match, and helping your clients understand this difference between last click and post-impression tracking is critical to building a foundation of trust and explaining differences in your reports.
<h4>Strategies for Reporting Success</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Clarify possible reasons for any gaps between reports to justify your results.</li>
 	<li>Show how every stage of the customer journey, including awareness, plays into your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-to-build-a-digital-campaign-strategy-to-gain-valuable-insights/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">metrics</a>.</li>

You've finally been given access to all the reporting systems and marketing programs you could want. Now what? Just because you've made the investment into site analytics, media platform reports and marketing automation platforms doesn't mean they automatically integrate with each other.

With performance numbers spread across several platforms, how do you make sense of all the data? More importantly, how do you use that information to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/ask-expert-secrets-great-digital-campaign-strategy/"">improve your marketing strategy</a>? We'll break it down so you can move from a state of analysis paralysis to a position of modern marketing bliss.
<h4>Do You Really Need All These Reports?</h4>
Quite simply, yes. One set of analytics just isn't enough to guide your entire <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-to-build-a-digital-campaign-strategy-to-gain-valuable-insights/"">marketing strategy</a>. But there are so many different platforms and reports you can use that it's not always easy to identify which ones are actually helpful. While several of these systems may seem to track the same things, truthfully, most of the metrics aren't interchangeable. To help you sift through the data more quickly, here's a quick rundown of what each platform typically tracks:

<h4>Metrics Matter. So Start Analyzing Them.</h4>
While there are limitless options of what can be done when pairing your reporting results, start with these best practices to combine data across platforms for maximum insight.

5949,It's Here: Mary Meeker's 2017 Report Recap for the Modern Marketer,"Google ""internet trends"", and you'll find an endless list of surveys, reports and predictions, but none are as anticipated each year as industry analyst Mary Meeker's Internet Trends Report. In its 22nd iteration, the <a href=""https://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2017 Internet Trends Report</a> released earlier this week continues to live up to the hype with over 350 research-based slides.

For marketers who don't have time to go through the entire 11-part report, we've recapped the top five trends and stats worth adding to your toolbox:
<h4>1. User growth may have flatlined, but online advertising continues to thrive.</h4>
The global internet adoption rate has plateaued at about 10% per year since 2012. But remember, that's over 400 million new users in 2016, with over half of the world's potential internet population still at large — meaning plenty of opportunities for online advertisers to continue to thrive in the years to come. Last year alone, online advertising was a $73 billion market, up 22% from 2015.

<h4>2. Mobile ad spending continues to accelerate, eclipsing desktop spending for the first time.</h4>
Americans devoted more than five hours per day to digital media in 2016, three of which were spent on mobile devices. So, it's not surprising to see significant growth in mobile ad spending; but according to Mary Meeker's 2017 report, mobile ad revenues eclipsed desktop ad revenues for the first time last year.

[bctt tweet=""Americans spent &gt;3 hours/day on mobile devices in 2016, according to Mary Meeker."" username=""goodwaygroup""]

And there's still a significant gap between time spent on mobile media and potential mobile ad spend. For advertisers ready to take advantage of this untapped $16 billion mobile ad space, people-based marketing capabilities <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advance-programmatic-advertising-put-first-party-data-first/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">leveraging their valuable first-party data</a> will be key.

<h4>3. Internet ad spending will top TV advertising this year.</h4>
According to Mary Meeker's 2017 report findings, global internet ad spending will surpass TV advertising in just six months. With the cord-cutter and cord-never populations growing every day, more and more advertisers are turning to online advertising to reach consumers where they're watching. As internet ad spending finally outpaces traditional TV near the $200 billion mark, savvy marketers will be talking about the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-questions-to-ask-before-buying-advanced-tv/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">advantages of advanced TV advertising</a> with their brand owners.

<h4>4. Ushered in by recent advances in augmented reality, online gaming has positive implications for advertisers.</h4>
Few people would have predicted the Pokémon Go sensation last fall, but the augmented reality app's success showcased the revenue potential of the online gaming industry. Unsurprisingly, this year's Internet Trends Report focuses on the rise of online gaming and its implications across several industries, like business and sports. The report estimates that there are 2.6 billion gamers online today, up from 100 million players in 1995. And as the ""most engaging form of social media,"" users spend over 50 minutes per day in gaming consoles, making gaming platforms a potential treasure trove for advertisers targeting highly engaged audiences.

<h4>5. The consumer voice will be more powerful than ever.</h4>
As voice recognition technologies continue to improve (accuracy for Google Home is now at nearly 95%), voice-based searches will replace typed queries. In 2016, 20% of mobile searchers were made via voice. And in the coming year, voice-activated searches are expected to take over the home, with <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/ask-the-expert-what-does-alexa-mean-for-programmatic-advertisers-and-marketers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">voice assistant devices</a> like Amazon's Alexa offering hands-free convenience around the house. In the fourth quarter of 2016, Amazon Echo devices already boasted over 8 million users.

When a new celebrity weight-loss story hits your newsfeed or a breakthrough miracle cure appears at the top of an internet search, it might seem legit at first. Unfortunately, these are often deliberate hoaxes or click bait disguised as real news stories. With the recent explosion of false news stories, every advertiser must learn how to avoid fake news sites.

According to <a href=""https://www.doubleverify.com/newsroom/2016/12/programmatic-platforms-adopt-new-doubleverify-solution-to-protect-advertisers-from-fake-news-online/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">DoubleVerify</a>, nearly half of the fake sites in our ecosystem didn't exist at the start of 2016, and traffic to many of those sites more than doubled by the end of the year. When the online reality doesn't add up, you might be left with a lot of questions about fake news. Now, you can get the answers.
<h4>You know you can't believe everything you read online, but what is fake news?</h4>
Fake news can take on a variety of shapes and varying degrees of falsehood. The <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/clinton-and-trump-digital-media-campaigns-by-the-numbers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2016 presidential election</a> brought issues surrounding fake news to the surface, but the reality is this phenomenon is widespread.

While the headlines may look credible, most fake news sites are entirely fictional or filled with misinformation, for instance, on the one hand, sites fabricating news about celebrity deaths. On the other hand, many also flag hyperpolitical sites that are far-left or -right leaning as fake news for driving their own agendas over full disclosure of the facts.

At Goodway Group, we block sites publishing clearly fake news, environments promoting sensational headlines or hate speech, those with unsubstantiated claims, and click bait sites. And we educate our partners and their advertiser clients on how to avoid fake news sites.
<h4>Are there easy ways for an advertiser to avoid fake news sites?</h4>
Fake news isn't just a problem for politicians; it hurts brands across every industry. Because you don't want your next ad to show up alongside bogus content, consider these strategies to protect your brand from becoming a fake news advertiser:
<ul>
 	<li>Think about the [ad] company you keep. Choose a programmatic partner that uses a blacklist updated regularly throughout your campaign rather than at the end of each flight because some fake news sites will switch domain names to re-enter your inventory.</li>
 	<li>Commit to quality above price. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/whats-programmatic-worth/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Ditch sites with low CPMs and high CTRs</a> because their results really are too good to be true.</li>
 	<li>Use a brand safety tool to identify fake news. Consider activating a third-party brand safety solution, such as <a href=""https://www.doubleverify.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">DoubleVerify</a> or <a href=""https://integralads.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Integral Ad Science</a>, to monitor and prevent fake news sites within your campaigns.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Does running on fake news sites hurt my campaign performance?</h4>
The short answer: absolutely. Goodway Group's media team recently ran a two-part performance test to answer this question. In the first phase of the test, Goodway's internal fake news blacklists improved eCPA results by as much as 7% over standard blacklists. The fake news blockers also positively impacted viewability scores and overall campaign performance.

When we layered in leading brand safety tools for the second phase of the test, nearly all fake news sites remaining were blocked from our inventory. This caused an improvement in eCPA results by up to 34% over standard blacklist results.

At Goodway, we don't support spreading misinformation or inflammatory content. To combat fake news and protect your brand, we can implement several protocols on our campaigns for enhanced brand safety.

6042,3 Tips to Heat Up Your Summer Ad Campaign,"<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6052 size-full"" title=""Summer campaign tips header"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/three-summer-campaign-tips-header.jpg"" alt=""Young woman in sunglasses looking at cell phone while in a hammock searching for summer campaign tips"" width=""1000"" height=""667"" />

As we officially usher in summer this month, it might be tempting to slow down your advertising efforts. While setting the cruise control on your marketing strategy may sound appealing, it's an easy way to drive your customers to the competition.

As the seasons change, your customers' habits change too. School is out, vacations are scheduled and the warm days stretch out late into the evening hours. All of this means your target audiences — whether they are kids, teens, professionals or retirees — aren't going to follow the usual rules of engagement. They aren't likely to be parked in front of the TV every night or logged into their email account all day, as outdoor fun and time off from work dominate their free time during these months.

Even if you aren't in a seasonal business, you can tap into these changes in online behaviors and shifts in schedules to adjust your ad budget, campaign messages and media approach. Here are a few summer campaign tips every marketer needs to start doing now to build brand awareness and boost sales through Labor Day.
<h4>MAKE MOBILE A PRIORITY</h4>
During the summer months, on the go doesn't necessarily mean your customers are out of touch. They're just using their mobile devices more frequently to answer their ""I want to know"" and ""where do I go"" questions. According to a recent study from Facebook, mobile device usage grew by 26 percent from May through September 2015.

[bctt tweet=""Mobile posting grows by 26% on Facebook during summer months. Get mobile ad strategy tips. "" username=""goodwaygroup""]

Now is the time to put your mobile ad strategy into high gear and switch to a cross-device advertising plan. Also, make sure that your landing pages, videos and web forms are made small screen-friendly to confirm successful conversion of your ads post-click.

Once you've covered the mobile basics, consider other unique approaches, such as a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/build-winning-mobile-app-strategy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">mobile app strategy</a>. With over 2.75 billion apps downloaded to tablets and mobile phones to date per <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a>, it should come as no surprise that marketers can use mobile apps to drive product discovery and motivate user engagement.
<h4>PICK UP YOUR PAID SEARCH</h4>
You are likely to see searches spread out across multiple devices during the coming months. Ninety percent of searchers switch between devices throughout the day, according to Google. To help target these users on the go, location-based and cross-device search marketing tactics are great starting points for those needing foolproof summer campaign tips.

Real estate agents typically see a boost during the summertime. Advanced programmatic geotargeting can take advantage of a geofence to target customers searching on their phones within a few blocks of an open house.

Similarly, the demand for restaurants with patios are higher than ever in the summer. Restaurants and QSR businesses fitting this bill should consider geotargeting solutions with personalized outdoor seating messages to help drive foot traffic within a certain radius.

As temperatures climb, so do automotive sales, which often reach annual highs during the warmest months of the year. According to recent research by Experian Automotive, 2015 sales of new non-luxury vehicles began rising in May and peaked in August at nearly 20 percent above the monthly average for the year. So, it's not surprising that automotive dealers will want to pick up their paid search campaign efforts from Memorial Day to Labor Day.

These industries aren't the only ones consumers are searching for in the summer. Travel, health and fitness, and entertainment are just a few of the additional verticals that can take advantage of an enhanced paid search campaign during summer months.
<h4>INCREASE SHARABILITY WITH PAID SOCIAL</h4>
Just because consumers will be out of sight from their computers this summer doesn't mean their social networks will be out of mind. According to Facebook, there was a 46% spike in posts tagged with travel during the summer of 2015, and the sharing of video content increased by 43% in that time.

From road trips across the country to gardening projects, people increasingly share summer activities on Facebook and Instagram. The top five summer topics with the most posts in 2015 included running, beaches, parties, parks and forests, and movies. So whether you're marketing energy drinks or festive decor, building an active paid social campaign is critical. Consider incorporating video creative, dynamic creative and cross-platform promotions to ensure you maximize relevance and reach while content peaks on social during summer months.

Some strategies just work better in the summer. But the momentum gained from these summer campaign tips shouldn't slow down as you turn the corner to the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/maximizing-your-q4-budget/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">last quarter of the year</a>. Continue to update your media plans so that your brand stays in front of your audience all year long.

What makes a company a great place to work? Is it bringing your dog to the office, yoga classes at lunch, book clubs with coworkers and company trips to exciting destinations? Those things are all great — and are all things we offer at Goodway Group — but they aren't what truly makes our company a great place to work. Our culture is.

Last week, Goodway Group was certified as a great workplace by the independent analysts at Great Place to Work®. Great Place to Work produces the annual Fortune ""100 Best Companies to Work For®"" list among others. A first-time recipient of this recognition, we're thrilled to find out that 98% of our employees say our workplace is great.

[bctt tweet=""At Goodway Group, 98% of employees say their workplace is great."" username=""goodwaygroup""]

Winning a spot on this year's Great Place to Work list required an in-depth assessment through the stringent Trust Index® survey. Over 200 of our employees (more than half our workforce population) participated in the vetting process, while our company contributed to an extensive questionnaire on our benefits, compensation policies, community impact, gender diversity and more.

The employee assessment asked our staff to rate us on 58 statements about behaviors that indicate the company's credibility, respect and fairness levels, as well as the individual's level of pride and camaraderie in our workplace. In addition to answering these questions, participants were required to respond to 10 standard demographic categories, share their primary motivation for working here and given the opportunity to provide further feedback in two open-ended comment areas.

But this one hits much closer to our hearts and to the heart of the company — our president <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/about/leadership/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dave Wolk</a> was named one of the <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Highest-Rated-CEOs-at-SMBs-LST_KQ0,26.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">highest rated CEOs on Glassdoor</a> this week.

While it wouldn't come as a shock to anyone who knows him, he received an impressive 97 percent approval rating from our employees, ranking him 14th on the U.S. Small &amp; Medium Companies list.

Before leader, boss or supervisor ever come up in conversation, most of us would characterize Dave as a friend. He's the first one to congratulate you on a big milestone, reaching out with a personal message, not an email template — trust me, I hung my birthday message on the fridge when I realized it was personally written by him. And he's always one of the last people left in the night swapping stories and jokes at our all-company parties every year. He's real with everyone in a way that no other CEO or president is; and it's this level of true honesty and kindness that you only expect from your good friends that sets the tone for the culture across our entire organization. So we couldn't be prouder to see our friend and president be recognized publicly for his amazing leadership.

Getting back to what got us here, our culture is more than a long list of benefits, perks and quirks.

Growing our headcount by 2,026% in ten years doesn't make it easy, but our leadership laid a foundation of mutual trust and transparency early.

Beyond things like world-class medical and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/core-values-inspired-maternity-leave-policy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">maternity leave</a> plans, profit-sharing quarterly bonuses, annual training budgets and generous time off, our first aha moment came when we took our company almost completely virtual. Our philosophy was to hire the best talent regardless of location so people can thrive in what they love to do wherever they love to do it. Ten years later, we've got over 400 people in 40 states and counting.

This virtual model gives employees better balance between their work and personal lives, but a dispersed workforce can make the more organic ways of meeting people from other teams and building friendships difficult. That's why our leadership created twice-annual all-company ""family reunions,"" lunch with Dave (our president) events, WeWork office subscriptions and many other unique opportunities for employees to interact with their coworkers.

In an industry characterized as having a heavy ""<a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/02/01/goodway-group-bucks-the-bro-culture-tech"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">bro-culture</a>,"" we achieved a 50/50 male to female executive breakdown.

If you're like most of us, during the summer months you become especially nostalgic for an old-fashioned hot dog, a well-played baseball game, and any kind of deal that saves a few bucks. The <a href=""https://www.hot-dog.org/culture/hot-dog-fast-facts"">National Hot Dog and Sausage Council </a>estimates Americans consume 20 billion hot dogs a year, which works out to about 17 hot dogs per person each summer.

As advertisers in every industry (including those selling frankfurters) slash prices to take advantage of summertime excitement, we're here to share three tips to maximize your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advance-programmatic-advertising-put-first-party-data-first/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">first-party data targeting</a> and enhance your seasonal ad strategy.
<h4>1. Track Every Interaction</h4>
Regardless of where your customer data comes from – offline addresses, online cookies, or just about anywhere else – it's data you own and can activate on to improve your media investment returns. It starts by tracking every interaction and connecting the dots between your customer's offline and online identities.

Every day people search and browse for a wide variety of products online, for instance gourmet hotdogs. The challenge, of course, is that consumers are often switching between desktops, mobile devices, and retail stores throughout their buying journey. This means in order to advertise to the right hot-dog-loving consumers when they are the hungriest, marketers must be able to identify their customers on every channel.

This is where companies with identity resolution solutions and CRM onboarding capabilities, like LiveRamp, Amazon, and Facebook, come in. They have huge databases of people with their cookies, devices IDs, social handles, and other online data saved in one place. These giant databases allow you to easily and quickly match the IDs from an online source (@FanaticForFranks) to a catering order in an offline source (New York Dog House) in a privacy safe setting.

Once you've matched your customer identities, personalizing your message for sausage aficionados becomes a snap. Of course, you might not want to hit everyone who has already bought your product. Eliminate wasted spend by excluding those folks from your ad campaign right from the start. As an added bonus, this also means you won't annoy loyal customers with ads that they don't need.
<h4>2. Target the Doppelgangers</h4>
Marketers have long relied on their first-party data to connect with their best customers, but now you can use that same data to identify and target new potential customers just like your best buyers. Since you already know who is interacting with your brand, it takes the guesswork out of finding new audiences to target.

By onboarding your data to a platform with identity resolution capabilities, you can map common characteristics and trends across millions of your customers at once. Then, you're able to use that information to build look-alike audiences and target people just like them. These are the types of people you want more of – your customers' doppelgangers who will buy from you again and again too.

Think about it like this: When a theme park buys a generic third-party segment like ""thrill seekers,"" some folks will naturally be in their ideal customer category. But because the segment is pretty broad, there will be a decent portion of users who aren't a very good match. When you identify segments that mirror characteristics in your own first-party data, you are able to better guarantee matches and more accurately grow your audience. For instance, when recently working with a theme park client to identify high-potential segments like their current customers, we discovered that minor league baseball fans were a more unique and high-potential match than thrill seekers. What a fun addition to their first-party data targeting efforts!

Get in the first-party data game by setting up a look-alike model or extension campaign in your ad serving platform to go after your like-minded consumers. For even better results, you can layer in knowledge gained from your media reports to target this segment with top-performing ad types.
<h4>3. Retarget Shopping Cart Abandoners</h4>
Smart marketers don't just focus on the results that are contributing to the bottom line. They also look to remove roadblocks to completing the sale. Think about all those customers who saw your ad, logged into your site, and filled up an online cart but didn't check out.

This first-party customer data is invaluable because it automatically tells you who is almost ready to buy. Supplement this with research from eMarketer reports that say 86% of shoppers place an item in their shopping cart but end up abandoning it simply due to the cost of shipping, and you have an unstoppable first-party data targeting opportunity.

Segment your shopping cart abandoners into a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/why-display-is-cooler-than-you-thought/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">banner ad retargeting campaign</a>, which allows you to serve ads only to those users. If your retargeting campaign features a free shipping message, it can re-engage hesitant shoppers and give them the extra push needed to convert. Then for even more tailored outreach, you can utilize dynamic retargeting ads that feature the products each user abandoned.

6162,Social Stories Give Instagram and Snapchat Ads Longer Shelf Life,"<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6240 size-full"" title=""Social Stories Give Instagram and Snapchat Ads Longer Shelf Life"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/social-stories-header.jpg"" alt=""group of friends sitting on steps looking at their phones and Snapchat ads"" width=""1000"" height=""450"" />

When it was first released, Snapchat's disappearing photos changed the game for many social media users. And as the platform grew, users and advertisers alike sought a way to give their posts a slightly longer shelf life for sharability. Enter the newest trend in social media: social stories.

Social stories are a collection of pictures of videos that can be viewed as many times as you'd like for a 24-hour period before they disappear. For users, this means a new fun way to keep up with friends. For marketers, it opens up a completely new way  to share their brand story via Instagram and Snapchat ads.
<h4>Advertising to Half a Billion Users</h4>
When you combine all the social media consumers from the top social platforms, you get an audience of more than 500 million daily users for marketers to tap into. So how can you take advantage of this massive audience pool?

Because social stories are built within the programmatic media environment, buying ad space is easy. Goodway’s expert trading team can buy social story ad inventory the same way your other paid social inventory is purchased, as well as at the same time that they buy your display, mobile, and video — adding an additional touch point to your user’s digital journey.

Just like when you buy display ads in social media platforms, you can target audiences based on DMAs, lifestyle trends and behaviors, demographics, specific brand categories, first-party look-alikes, and carrier or device operating systems — meaning you get confidence knowing your ads are personally relevant to the people you want to reach.

Because social stories are exclusively for mobile users, you can share your brand message in a way that fits how consumers actually use their smartphones with immersive full-screen video ads. Your 10-second video spot is played in a user’s feed when they watch stories from friends, brands, celebrities, and influencers they follow. When 10 seconds isn’t enough to share your message, you can drive viewers to swipe for a feature presentation, small screen-friendly web page, instant download and more, without making users leave the app.

As with most video ads, brand awareness metrics like completion rate and reach are the best fit for social story campaigns. However, swipe, click-through, and app install actions can make these kinds of ads a match for online sales and direct response campaigns as well.

When creating Instagram or Snapchat ads, remember a few key specifications:

<h4>SHARing IS CONTAGIOUS</h4>
It’s no coincidence that when Snapchat introduced stories in 2013, Facebook started seeing a decline in engagement from their youngest user audience. After a failed attempt to acquire Snapchat in 2015, Facebook decided to launch their own stories feature in both Instagram and Facebook. As social story features continue to grow, so do the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/paid-social-advertising-trends-social-media-marketing-world/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">opportunities to advertise to an engaged audience</a>.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6237 size-full"" title=""social stories preferred platform bar chart"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/social-stories-bar-chart.png"" alt=""social stories preferred platform by age group bar chart "" width=""696"" height=""765"" />

Despite the still relatively short lifespan of Instagram and Snapchat ads through social stories, marketers are loving the high viewer engagement and interaction they bring. For instance, Snapchat is opened over 20 times per day by users under 25 years old and 12 times per day by those older than 25. So, those targeting younger audiences or consumer brands in the QSR, travel, education, or auto industries are the most common advertisers, but any brand with video creative can run a social story ad campaign.

Already, brands like Airbnb and Mulberry UK are seeing amazing results. <a href=""https://business.instagram.com/blog/instagram-stories-available-globally"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Airbnb ran a social stories campaign</a> to build awareness and buzz around their newest experiences product during Instagram’s pilot program. Based on the campaign, the company saw a double-digit increase in ad recall. Similarly, <a href=""https://business.instagram.com/blog/bringing-insights-and-ads-to-stories/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Mulberry’s recent social stories campaign</a> received five times more site clicks and increased engagement when compared to the other paid social campaigns.","Social stories are a collection of pictures of videos that can be viewed as many times as you'd like for a 24-hour period before they disappear.

Optimizing your programmatic media campaign is key to driving a powerful marketing machine. Of course, tweaking your bids, creative elements, and audience segments are the most obvious and some of the quickest ways to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-ways-ai-marketing-will-revolutionize-ad-campaigns/"">increase your campaign’s effectiveness</a>. But there are several other ways to optimize campaign ROI without ever touching your media.

In the daily grind to ensure every dollar of their hard-earned ad budget is being spent wisely, many marketers simply forget to leverage levers outside of their media buy to get the most performance possible out of their campaigns. Their landing pages lack call-to-action buttons. Websites become slow and dated. And media quality takes a backseat to hitting lower CPMs.

To make meaningful improvements in your campaign, you can’t silo your strategy and just focus on the media buy. Optimize for the entire customer journey with these easy tips, and watch as small changes add up to big numbers when it comes to your conversions.
<h4>Reassess Your Landing Pages</h4>
A big part of marketing is knowing which campaign elements are most effective and optimizing toward those. You can do this with your landing pages too.

The first step is setting up your page to collect metrics on what’s working and what’s not. With specialized A/B testing, you can run conversion-optimization campaigns to determine which website elements drive the most conversions. You can test different variations of your fonts, layouts, forms, and call-to-action buttons to ensure you’re providing the best possible user experience.

Once you start getting results, it can be tempting to ""set and forget"" your landing pages over the course of many campaigns. However, if you want to really optimize campaign ROI and keep turning your visitors into customers, you must continue to evaluate your site elements on a regular basis.
<h4>Find Out Why They’re Bouncing</h4>
High bounce rates on your website can mean one of two things: you’re getting the wrong kind of traffic to your site, or you’re getting exactly the right kind. Quick exits sometimes mean that your visitors found exactly what they were looking for, but they didn’t have a reason to keep browsing. Make sure you feature links to other pages on your site and additional resources in order to keep your visitors interested.

However, if your site isn’t relevant or easy to navigate for on-the-go visitors, of course, they’ll leave. There are dozens of top-notch website analytics tools on the market that can improve your bounce rates by removing channels sending low-value traffic and optimizing your layouts for mobile screens.

Even if your site is extremely easy to use, most of the time your visitors will be in a hurry. If your site takes too long to load, you’ll lose that customer to the competition. According to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a>, 62% of consumers are unwilling to wait more than five seconds for a webpage to load.  Check your site’s results in Google Analytics and focus on improving pages with the highest bounce rates, highest exit rates, and highest page load times to increase your chances of creating a conversion.
<h4>Make It Easy to Find You</h4>
Regardless of how many retargeting ads you put out there, some people still prefer to start from a search engine. According to Google, 48% of the time a mobile journey to researching a brand starts with a search engine. That’s not to say your ad wasn’t successful in driving the awareness that kicked off this journey, but some customers still want to do the research and take a more organic route to your site.

In these cases, it’s important that your site ranks high in search engine results for key products and words associated with your brand. Search engines are constantly crawling the web looking for fresh, relevant content and optimized images and videos on your site. So, the first step is to develop quality content, like blog posts and product pages featuring your top keywords. The second step is to keep them up-to-date. Also, be sure to use an SEO strategy that’s diversified with non-branded terms.

Then, establish your credibility with search engines through keyword targeting, link acquisition, content syndication, and social media tactics. These will drive up your PageRank, or how trustworthy the search engine believes your page is on a particular topic.

Finally, keep your SEM strategies on the cutting edge with targeted <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-tips-heat-summer-ad-campaign/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">paid search campaigns</a> to truly optimize campaign ROI. It may not be the sexiest marketing tactic, but location-based and cross-device paid search campaigns are a great starting point for those needing foolproof results.
<h4>Prioritize Quality Over Price</h4>
Before you celebrate that amazing deal you just picked up, make sure the inventory isn’t from the bargain bin. Often, inventory selling at low CPMs are fraud-ridden, with bots driving up click rates rather than true conversion rates.

While our ability to detect fraud through ad verification tools is significant, there are several additional ways to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/whats-programmatic-costing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ensure the inventory you’re buying is legit</a>. Most important among them is to insist on using premium inventory from suppliers you trust. While your ad prices may go up with this strategy, you’ll likely get more value out of your media so your performance and brand safety actually improve beyond the cost difference.

6457,5 Creative Banner Ads We Love,"Every digital marketer knows that your creative can make or break your campaign. We’ve already shared tips on the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/6-creative-best-practices-for-a-successful-digital-ad/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">creative best practices</a>  to follow, but what about some real-world examples of great creative banner ads? We’ve rounded up a few of our recent favorite banner creatives to inspire you.
<h4>Company: Airbnb</h4>
Why it Works: This ad is clean and simple with an interesting image and one sentence of contrasting text. The call-to-action button is in a bright, eye-catching color and subtly asks people to “learn more” rather than a more direct “book now.” It’s a perfect message for brand awareness. Also, the Airbnb logo is noticeable in the corner but doesn’t dominate the creative.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6474 size-full"" title=""5 Creatives We Love"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/airbnb-banner-ad.png"" alt=""Airbnb creative banner ad"" width=""300"" height=""250"" />
<h4>Company: Visit Pensacola</h4>
Why it Works: The image here is everything – a young couple hand-in-hand in the ocean with a sunny blue sky behind them. There’s no better way to sell a vacation destination. The logo is the website and main message of the ad, which is a clever way to save space. The only other element is the call to action on a brightly colored button, telling folks to book a getaway. It all adds up to a simple, effective ad.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6476 size-full"" title=""5 Creatives We Love"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pensacola-banner-ad.png"" alt=""Pensacola creative banner ad"" width=""300"" height=""600"" />
<h4>Company: Benefit</h4>
Why it Works: The background is bold and pops against a white background, but it’s not offensively bold.  The main image of the woman is compelling and enhanced by the “magical” starbursts. The text is minimal but conveys a strong brand message with credibility (since 1976) and benefits (your brows will be magically transformed). The call to action is crisp and contrasts with the image to encourage users to book now. Finally, the logo is prominent at the top, letting users identify the brand immediately.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6475 size-full"" title=""5 Creatives We Love"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/benefit-banner-ad.jpg"" alt=""Benefit creative banner ad"" width=""300"" height=""600"" />
<h4>Company: Tableau</h4>
Why it Works: This ad is darker than our other examples, but the simple geometric design is pleasing to the eye. It’s a great design choice for a company that doesn’t lend itself well to small-format visuals, as Tableau focuses on data and reporting software. The text offers a clear benefit – top ten business intelligence trends for 2017 and encourages users to click. The logo is noticeable, so users know who is behind the report, yet it's subtle, putting the focus on the trends.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6478 size-full"" title=""5 Creatives We Love"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tableau-banner-ad.jpg"" alt=""Tableau creative banner ad"" width=""300"" height=""600"" />
<h4>Company: Samsung</h4>
Why it Works: Similar to the other ads we’ve featured, Samsung’s creative leads with a bold image and features minimal text. You can just imagine someone taking this photo to put it on Instagram or Snapchat. The company name and product name are mentioned, but not too prominently to distract from the main image. The rest of the text is sparse, getting across the idea of using your phone to take a picture and emphasizing the quality of the screen. Finally, Samsung chose an interesting call to action – instead of using text, they just feature a button that looks like a “next” or “more” button that you’d see to scroll through a web page, indicating that you’ll learn more by clicking.

There are a lot of articles I read only to end up shaking my head.  Then there are those that leave me like this:

<img class=""alignnone size-full"" src=""https://2jzjya5nuiz3nvqno46nsh1u-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/jon-stewart.png"" width=""717"" height=""418"" />

To be fair to Ryan, <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/ad-exchange-news/in-the-quest-for-100-viewability-everyone-is-taking-a-different-path/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">it wasn’t his writing</a> as much as it was commentary by others.  Skip down to the quote by Jennifer Gardner of Unilever. “We define viewability as an ad that is viewed by a real person who is in our target audience in an appropriate environment.”  Let’s dissect.  “Viewed?” Fair enough. “Real person?” Sounds reasonable. “Target audience?” Hold up. Are we talking about viewability or targeting efficacy? Then, “appropriate environment.” Again, this has nothing to do with viewability. This, from the Director of Media Investment and Partnerships at a colossal consumer packaged goods organization.  Feeling like Jon Stewart yet? It gets better.

Deeper in the article, Ryan Bonifacino, SVP of digital at Alex and Ani, mixes in the issue of attributing conversions and states that viewability concerns are raised with lower funnel attribution while fraud occurs in mid- to upper-funnel.  Maybe his comments were taken out of context, but an ad can be determined in-view or out-of-view regardless of where it took place in the funnel.  Ad fraud can, and does, occur in any environment, and is not just bots but often unseen ads on real human’s browsers - regardless of where that user is in the funnel.

It doesn’t get much more inefficient than the U.S. is congress. It’s 15% average approval rating in 2014 and the fact that the <a href=""https://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2013/01/congress-somewhere-below-cockroaches-traffic-jams-and-nickleback-in-americans-esteem.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">public rated cockroaches and traffic jams</a> above them show just how bad it is. The stats don’t shock me, though. Have you ever heard how quickly the rhetoric goes off track when discussing an issue?  Take immigration. Have you noticed how quickly a politician takes the immigration issue and says, “We can’t fix immigration without first fixing the poverty levels in this country, ensuring that everyone gets a good education, and the value of the dollar is strong to support the hard-working middle class that work hard to earn a living each day.”  Rather than sticking with immigration and focusing on fixing a few obviously problems with common sense solutions, the issues of poverty/welfare, education, and the fed’s dollar policy are intertwined. No bill could even attempt to fix all of these issues, nor would any congressional member put their name on it and introduce it.  Actually, that’s the point.  Congress doesn’t want to fix things because it might jeopardize their re-election.  However, we’re not up for re-election, so why are we acting like this?

Ryan Joe, the author, astutely writes, “So now the scenario is such that viewability, attribution and fraud are all intertwined. Yet they’re all separate measurements.”  I would encourage Jennifer and Ryan to look at each of these very separately.  We absolutely can make progress on each one without touching the other.  What will happen is that by improving each one a little at a time – like kicking a bowling ball up a soccer field – the three will ultimately meet at the goal line and enable each other’s success.

<em>By: Olivia Bias, SVP of Sales Operations for Goodway Group</em>

Paid search management &amp; strategy has come a long way since the days of Lycos and AltaVista in the mid-1990s.  Besides Google now being the dominant engine, search strategists now have to consider a myriad of factors in order to run a successful campaign such as increased competition as more advertisers have come on board and more sophisticated user psychology patterns as users navigate through an increasingly complex online environment.

Has your SEM kept up-to-date with the times?  Here are two areas on which you can focus now to keep your search competitive amidst changing technology and user behaviors:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Optimize towards the mobile user experience</strong> – if there is one thing you can do this year to improve your search results that would be to ensure that your users have a painless experience discovering your business through search on their phones.  Did you know that beginning early last year, more Americans <a href=""https://money.cnn.com/2014/02/28/technology/mobile/mobile-apps-internet/"">(55%)</a> used devices to access the internet over PCs?  This is a huge shift in user behavior and a trend that will only become more prevalent in the months and years ahead.  Mobile considerations:
<ul>
 	<li>Implementing click-to-call extensions that make calling your business easy</li>
 	<li>Implementing app-extensions that make app download easy via the ad</li>
 	<li>Device-optimized landing pages and sites</li>
 	<li>Optimizing towards mobile technology factors such as device type or OS</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Optimize towards conversions</strong> – Since you pay for clicks it is only natural to want to optimize towards clicks, but a better long-term strategy is to optimize towards users who are engaging and taking meaningful actions on your site.  Google’s Quality Score algorithms have become more favorable towards advertisers who do a better job of delivering what users are actually looking for and they measure this through bounce rates, time on site, etc.  So while clicks are important – they get your “foot in the door” with the user – conversion optimization will help you drive a better quality score, better page position, and ultimately lower CPCs in the long run.</li>
</ol>

Aside from display re-targeting, display (mobile or desktop) and video are at the very top.  What this means is that these tactics aren’t as effective as they could be until everything else underneath is well-funded and intelligently deployed.  This is because each “level up” catalyzes the benefit of what’s been done before.

So when the time comes to rev up the banner and video machine, a brand or product should be at a point where the first three layers are nearing the point of diminishing return.  However, just because you’ve been measuring clicks through Google Analytics to attribute performance and success for the first three layers doesn’t mean that is the way to continue forward.  In fact, if you do, you’re going to need to hammer really hard.

Imagine you’re a swimmer. World-class, too. You know how far and long your initial dive should be, how to time your turn at the end of the pool, and how to align your breathing with your stroke.  But now you decide to take up running.  So you hire a coach.  You ask, “how far do I dive and how long do I stay down before I come up for air?” The coach tells you that running is different.  You’re going to need to train, understand, and measure success differently.  In fact, the coach tells you you’ll never win a national championship without shoes.  “Uh, been there done that!”  Display banners and video are <em>that</em> different from the rest of the pyramid.  Using Google Analytics and last click attribution to measure the success of your display is absolutely no less crazy than judging the quality of a runner by how well he turns at the end of a lap and starts running backward.

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Display banners are clickable, but display advertising is not created for clicking.</span>  Big difference there.  Why should you believe this? Let’s look at several studies that have been done to demonstrate that not only does a display click have little to no value, it will actually send you in the opposite direction in optimizing your media and audience.
<ol>
 	<li>18 years ago (!) the <a href=""https://www.utdallas.edu/~liebowit/knowledge_goods/iabstudy.pdf"">IAB came out with a study</a> showing that even the 2% click through rates of the time didn’t add value or provide a good metric.</li>
 	<li>11 years later, comScore and Starcom released the famous “<a href=""https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2008/02/Display-Ad-Click-Through-Behavior"">Natural Born Clickers</a>” story.</li>
 	<li>If this wasn’t case closed, they <a href=""https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2009/10/comScore-and-Starcom-USA-Release-Updated-Natural-Born-Clickers-Study-Showing-50-Percent-Drop-in-Number-of-U.S.-Internet-Users-Who-Click-on-Display-Ads"">followed up on the study</a> a year later to ensure the results hadn’t changed. They had.  They’d gotten worse. 8% of internet users account for 85% of clicks? Hmmm.</li>
 	<li>Nielsen also jumped in. In 2011 <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/162009/disconnect-nielsen-finds-no-relationship-between.html?edition=40075"">Nielsen released a study</a> demonstrated no relationship between clicks and brand metrics or offline sales.</li>
 	<li>In 2012 comScore again discussed the <a href=""https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2012/4/For-Display-Ads-Being-Seen-Matters-More-than-Being-Clicked"">(lack of) value of the click</a>, showing a <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">.01</span> correlation between clicking and conversion/purchase. .01! It literally couldn’t get any worse!</li>
 	<li>Then the <a href=""https://bit.ly/1a5YvEx"">IAB implemented a test where it ran banners with nothing in them</a>. Some were a pure white box, others were a pure orange box. The result? These “banners of nothing” achieved the same click through rate the industry sees with brand and direct response banners.</li>
</ol>
Furthermore, there have been even more studies <a href=""https://yhoo.it/1wSH5nt"">demonstrating</a> how <a href=""https://bit.ly/Q7Q56I"">display actually drives more search</a> traffic, proving that higher pyramid layers build on each other.  These are just two of 10+ studies that have been published in this space.

The moral? Square pegs or swimming training – you name the metaphor – don’t work when the new environment isn’t built to be measured the same way.  Let the ad server do the hard work of measuring display banner and video campaigns in such a way that you can learn the true value of your media investment. If you insist on using last click, you should consider sticking with swimming.

The bread and butter of our role is reporting out a campaign’s success. Every report will include the basic metrics, such as impressions served, click-thru rate and Effective Cost per Action, but different campaigns have different successes. An auto campaign’s KPI may be completely different from a State Lottery’s KPI.

As part of client services, it’s our job to identify the goal for each campaign and provide the best metrics possible to tell that story. We have a robust reporting library that allows us to highlight many different aspects of a campaign, including:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Activities –</strong> how many post-click and post-impressions were generated from the campaign?</li>
 	<li><strong>Ad Sizes</strong> – did the 728x90 perform better than the 300x250?</li>
 	<li><strong>Audience Composition </strong>– what was the male/female breakout? Age range? Household income?</li>
 	<li><strong>Creative </strong>– did creative set #2 have a higher click-thru rate than creative set #1?</li>
 	<li><strong>Heat Maps with Zip Code</strong> – which zip code had the highest conversion rate?</li>
 	<li><strong>Markets</strong> – how did DMA perform versus another?</li>
 	<li><strong>Pre-Roll</strong> – how many people viewed the entire video? Many people viewed half the video?</li>
 	<li><strong>Tactics</strong> – did mobile targeting outperform domain retargeting?</li>
 	<li><strong>Time/Day</strong> – which date of the week or time of the day was the most effective</li>
</ul>
Reporting is something that is customizable to the client and it’s our job to help identify
what makes a campaign a success. Depending on the size of the campaign, we can even set up an online reporting dashboard so a client can pull up-to-date metrics before going into a meeting or closing out for the weekend.

It’s our job to make you a hero and a hero can’t save the world without the proper tools!

This time last year the debate was raging over the death of the third-party cookie.

We wondered: How will we track mobile conversions given the app sandbox? And will clients have first-party data at scale to target media? These questions, at the time, were relevant. But it seems I haven’t heard them much in the last few months. It could be “viewability” just seems to dominate every conversation in the online media world these days. Or it could be there’s a new crop of companies thinking about mobile targeting and attribution that may be allaying the concerns a cookieless world presents.

<h2>The Problem with Cookies on Mobile</h2>
Audience targeting on the desktop uses cookies to infer user behavior and assign attributes based on that behavior. Basically, those attributes are packaged into targeting segments like, “Monster Truck Fanatics”. Mobile audience targeting presents two challenges that cookies on a desktop browser don’t. First, some mobile browsers, i.e., Safari, don’t allow third-party cookies by default—a user must opt in via the phone’s settings. This presents a challenge for marketers because Apple’s smartphone market share is about 50% and prevents accurate attribution. The second challenge is the sandboxing of mobile apps. “Sandboxing” prevents apps from sharing cookies with mobile browsers. This also makes tracking conversions difficult.
<h2>Going “Native” with Mobile Audience Targeting</h2>
We often hear one of the greatest benefits of mobile targeting is the ability to do so based on location or hyperlocation—messaging a customer or prospect when he or she is right at your store’s doorstep. This may be a successful tactic in certain circumstances, like when there’s scale, or when first-party data also is being used. But location doesn’t equal intent. And for mobile targeting to resemble behavioral targeting we can do with cookies, <em>there has to be an element of intent</em>.

I’ve recently evaluated a number of companies that have accomplished this. Their approach is to analyze signals other than location and device ID, time of day, app-usage habits, other signals in the ad call, and, sometimes, registration data. When these attributes are processed and segmented into audiences we can access in our DSP, they create a richer profile of a prospective customer rather than relying on location alone.

This is a significant step toward developing a more “native” approach to targeting on mobile devices. Using the technical components (Wi-Fi networks, device IDs, and ad-call information) native to the mobile format takes advantage of how we all use our smartphones and tablets. Furthermore, it reinforces Goodway’s goal of ensuring our clients can successfully reach their target audiences. Adding context and intent to location gets us closer to achieving that goal.

During his tenure in both positions, he was responsible for generating numerous strategic advertising opportunities with Fortune 500 companies looking for digital exposure on Microsoft's global advertising network.

“As a third-generation member of the family-owned Goodway Group, our mission is to shape the company’s future 10, 20 and even 50 years down the road,” said David Wolk, president of the Goodway Group. “Acquiring talent such as Brody O’Harran will provide the expert level of programmatic talent, experience and mindset necessary to thrive in the marketplace while continuing the explosive growth we’ve achieved in the past five years.”

O’Harran joins an increasing list of employee hires in the past six months as the company continues to expand into new markets, both in the U.S. and abroad.

“As I’ve watched and noted the dramatic rise in the programmatic landscape, I’ve consistently been impressed with Goodway’s business results and thought leadership,” said O’Harran. “Their correct blend of insight, transparency and high-level client service lead me to believe that, together, we can become an even more valued programmatic partner to clients around the world.”

Have you ever been ready to launch a digital ad campaign when you realized your creative is delivering the wrong message? Or worse, no message at all? The <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/6-creative-best-practices-for-a-successful-digital-ad/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">right creative</a> can make or break your campaign. Before your ads fall flat on both your audience and your KPIs, check out these guidelines to make sure your creative strategy aligns with your campaign goals:

</div>
<style media=""screen"" type=""text/css"">
<p>#tablepress_container {<br />   width:100%;<br />    overflow: hidden;<br />}<br />#div_one {<br />   width:50%;<br />   float:left;<br />}<br />#div_two {<br />   width:48%;<br />   float:right;<br />   margin-left:2%;<br />}<br />@media only screen and (max-width: 767px)<br />{<br />    #div_one, #div_two<br />    {<br />        display: block;<br />        float: none;<br />        width: 100%;<br />        padding: 20px 0;<br />    }<br />}</p>
</style>
<div id=""tablepress_container"">
<div id=""div_one"">
<h4>Set Clear Expectations</h4>
It is essential to align your creative strategy with campaign objectives early on. A good place to start is to outline what your goals are for the digital campaign before starting on the creative. What do you want your campaign to achieve? Is there a problem you are trying to solve? How will you measure success?

Your goals and KPIs will set the tone for what the creative is trying to accomplish and what elements designers should incorporate into the ads.

</div>
<div id=""div_two"">[table id=10 /]</div>
</div>
<h4>Tell Users What to Do</h4>
What are you asking users to do? An ad that is beautiful but doesn't drive users to do something won't help you achieve your goals. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-creative-ads-love/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Create strong messages that will get a response</a>.

If you want to drive conversions or new leads, try creating a sense of urgency or scarcity in your message. Many of the problems that affect conversion rates are users thinking too hard, waiting too long, or simply not responding to the ad's call to action. Raising the urgency level can cut through a lot of this delay and significantly improve conversion rates. If your ad is strictly for an awareness campaign, yor driver could be an emotional message and a website mention as the implied call to action.

<h4>Look at the Bigger Picture</h4>
How does your creative fit within the overall media plan? Having a creative message that resonates with what your audience is seeing elsewhere is one of the most important elements of a successful digital advertising campaign.

Remember, your audience may change depending on the reach of the flight, for instance, locally, nationally, or internationally. If you have the budget and the ability, it is highly recommended to tailor different creatives to different audiences while ensuring messaging for that audience stays consistent across all channels. Try also matching different goals to your different audiences to see better results.

<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-6959 size-full"" title=""creative-strategy-audience-versus-message-focus-graphic"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/matching_creative_to_goals_travel_agency2.png"" alt=""creative strategy travel agency example"" width=""562"" height=""560"" />
<h4>Track, Measure, and Adapt</h4>
Don't wait until the campaign is over to decide whether or not your creative is working. Once your campaign goals and correlating creatives are in place, try out some basic A/B testing on your designs to see which creative treatment performs better for your audience. Here are some things to consider when setting up an A/B test:
<ul>
 	<li>Change only one element of the creative per test to isolate the catalyst</li>
 	<li>Tests can be applied across multiple creatives</li>
 	<li>Use the same size ads across the test</li>
 	<li>Collect at least four weeks' worth of data before selecting a winner</li>
</ul>
Your test can be as simple as different calls to action or trying out different images. Whatever you test, it's important to track how people are engaging with your assets and apply those findings across all platforms. Now it's time to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/creative-best-practices-guide/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">let your creative shine</a>. With a creative strategy that complements your campaign goals, you're sure to dazzle both your clients and your customers alike.

10866,Ask the Expert: Mobile Location Data Policy Changes,"Apple’s latest iPhone isn’t the only mobile announcement that marketers need to pay attention to this fall. Both Apple and Google have <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/mobile/android-ios-updates-pump-brakes-location-data/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">announced</a> recent location data policy <a href=""https://www.appboy.com/blog/android-o-ios-11-location-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">changes</a>. Apple plans to alert users to location data tracking with a blue bar at the top of the screen, which should give users more insight into which apps are requesting their data. Google is trying out a different approach with Android, limiting the frequency with which apps can ask for location data from every few minutes to a few times per hour. We spoke with Ocean Fine at <a href=""https://www.factual.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Factual</a> to get her take on these announcements:

[caption id=""attachment_7044"" align=""alignleft"" width=""200""]<img class=""size-full wp-image-7044"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Ocean-Fine-Factual-Headshot.jpg"" alt=""Ocean Fine Factual Headshot"" width=""200"" height=""200"" /> Ocean Fine[/caption]
<h4>How Will Location Data Policy Changes Affect Mobile Marketers?</h4>
<h4>Q&amp;A with Ocean Fine</h4>
<em>As the VP of Agencies and Strategic Partners at Factual, Ocean is responsible for driving awareness and adoption of the company's Location Targeting Ad Solutions. A digital advertising veteran with 15 years experience working for and with agencies and brands, she loves working on the newest technologies in mobile and has a proven track record for building and growing teams that focus on all aspects of mobile channel enablement, from sales, strategy, and planning to launching first-to-market innovative mobile companies.</em>

<hr />

<h4><strong>How will the upcoming Android and iOS location data policy changes impact the advertising industry as a whole</strong>?</h4>
The forthcoming changes in iOS 11 will force the advertising industry to be more transparent, and transparency is a good thing. Consumer trust is paramount, and at Factual we have always treated consumer data with the utmost respect. Consumers should be empowered to understand and control when and how their data is shared. We applaud Apple’s efforts to bring more transparency and consumer control to their app ecosystems.

Android O is taking a similar approach to limiting location data in the background by decreasing the number of requests to a few per hour. If more frequent location data is needed, developers will have to bring their app to the foreground or utilize a foreground service. In the same sense as iOS 11, it will limit apps from passively collecting user location data.

Both the Android and iOS changes don’t affect apps using geofences and some other forms of low power consumption, location-based data enrichment.
<h4><strong>Do you see a significant difference in impact between Android’s changes in data collection frequency and Apple’s decision to alert consumers more clearly about location tracking?</strong></h4>
Android’s changes may have a lower impact since their approach is a bit more passive. Android seems to be deciding for the consumer by limiting the frequency of location data collection, while Apple ensures consumers understand what data they are sharing and ultimately puts the choice in the hands of the user.

Time will tell regarding the impact of each change. Remember geolocation data is supplied by multiple sources, including advertising services providers, mobile app service providers, and data aggregators. Bid stream data may not see as much of an impact.
<h4><strong>Will these changes affect Factual?</strong></h4>
This will mostly impact data providers relying on opaque or questionable data acquisition practices. Transparency and data quality are among Factual’s key differentiators, and we have always strived to establish partnerships with high-quality data sources. We do not believe these changes will significantly impact the breadth of our data partnerships or the scale of our data assets. If anything, it will continue our focus on working with reliable companies and partners and highlight our efforts to build products that support the industry in collecting and processing compliant and highly accurate location data.
<h4><strong>How do you see these changes fitting in with the larger industry trend of moving toward more transparency?</strong></h4>
These changes put more control in the consumer's hands (no pun intended…as they update their setting on their mobile phone). This is not a new discussion point for marketers and publishers. We talk to our partners regularly about the value exchange of collecting location data through their customer-facing applications. For example, “What value does a publisher provide a user in exchange for their location data?” These changes will only amplify the importance of this value exchange and build stronger trust and better customer experiences for the publishers that do it right.

We’ve also seen a few companies move toward a more transparent business model—i.e., unbundling data from media buying. Marketers and agencies want transparency, and it’s quite difficult to provide transparency on data quality when it is bundled with media. We will see more companies make this transition, and new companies that enter the space will follow.

At Factual, we believe in transparency. It is one of our core cultural values, and we have always built our products with transparency in mind. For example, our data is freely available on our website for viewing and exploration.
<h4><strong>What can advertisers do to prepare for these changes?</strong></h4>
Marketers need to research the changes and be aware of when they begin, but they should also look to their trusted partners, like Goodway Group and Factual, to help navigate the ever-changing mobile and data landscape. Be sure to ask your partners where their location data is coming from and how it is collected. It’s important to understand the partnerships, technology, and processes they have put in place to ensure the best product and compliance.",Both Apple and Google have announced recent location data policy changes.

10867,What You Missed: Ad Tech's 3 Hottest Trends from DMEXCO,"<img class=""aligncenter wp-image-7067 size-full"" title=""blurred trade show stand"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2017-dmexco-header.jpg"" alt=""What You Missed: Ad Tech's 3 Hottest Trends from DMEXCO"" width=""1000"" height=""481"" />

The world’s largest digital media and advertising technology (ad tech) conference isn’t in New York, San Francisco, or even London. It’s in Cologne, Germany. DMEXCO takes place each year during the second week of September. Over 50,000 digital media professionals from around the globe gather to discuss the state of the industry and determine how to take advantage of the many opportunities that still exist in digital. For those who didn’t attend, here is a recap of the three hottest topics and trends from <a href=""https://dmexco.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">DMEXCO</a>.
<h4>GDPR</h4>
There is no hotter topic in Europe right now, and it’s likely to have a global impact. The short explanation is that GDPR is an EU law which, as of May 2018, requires everyone in the ad tech chain to have a direct first-party relationship with the user in order to apply that user’s data to target them on any digitally connected device.

This relationship is often obtained via a pop-up on a site asking the user to agree to the use of cookies or tracking in order to access content. There are often more than 20 entities involved in auctioning off just one ad programmatically, and, clearly, we don’t expect users to sit there and click “accept” 20 times. On the other hand, the programmatic ecosystem is not only where all digital media is headed but how publishers and content developers monetize their business. Marketers pay more for impressions with data because it delivers a much better ROI.

While a good effort to protect consumers from being taken advantage of by unauthorized use of personal information, this law will clearly have unintended consequences, and no one can agree on exactly what can cause a fine. And what is that fine? Four percent of global revenues by the offender. If P&amp;G is fined, its fine could be larger than the GDP of Malta, EU’s smallest member. Data companies are scrambling, and the rest are simply trying to mitigate risk. Our take? This will be interesting.
<h4>Transparency</h4>
Marketers want full transparency, but agencies show that when provided with that transparency, marketers are often unwilling to pay what it really costs to do good work with digital media. Because of this tug-of-war between marketers and agencies, many marketers are now bringing in large consulting firms (at many times the hourly rate of an agency, ironically enough) to audit and provide insight into media cost structures.

Our take? Very few industries are this paranoid about transparency, but very few industries are as hard to measure as media. When value is easily measured, cost structures are less scrutinized. Digital media should focus on becoming more measurable but also shouldn’t ignore the marketer’s need to better understand the cost structures within our ecosystem.
<h4>Post-Fraud</h4>
It feels like the industry will have fraud well managed before the next DMEXCO conference. The three broad categories of fraud are bots, domain spoofing, and format fraud.

The <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/the-trade-desk-and-white-ops-are-teaming-up-to-block-bot-traffic-before-advertisers-buy-it/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">recent announcement</a> by The Trade Desk to include White Ops fraud detection (frequently cited as best in the business) on 100 percent of its traffic was the first of many steps to get bot fraud to a manageable place where the cost to marketers is minimal. Domain spoofing will be largely solved by the <a href=""https://iabtechlab.com/ads-txt-about/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ads.txt</a> initiative, which we believe will drive most bad actors out of the SSP business.

Format fraud still looms large, though. In recent conversations we’ve had with publishers, we’re seeing near complete sellout of all desktop video inventory. Marketers still expect full player pre-roll and video at low rates, but too much of this is in-banner auto-play with high completion rates. The industry does not yet have an acceptable way to solve this, other than identifying when completion rates and pricing are too good to be true.

I talked to one marketer as the week was closing out, and they lamented the complexity of digital media. There is no guide to the perfect metric. There is no perfect answer to solving for viewability and fraud. I reminded this person when the first rubber car tire was invented, it was pretty terrible compared to what we have today. But that inventor would surely lament the need for a PhD in chemistry in order to make any advancements in today’s tire technology. Every industry only gets more complex, and it’s those who embrace the complexity that come out ahead.

As consumers, artificial intelligence (AI) is an everyday part of our lives – whether we realize it or not. AI technology powers our Google Maps, Siri, Tesla self-driving cars, and Netflix.

Even as artificial intelligence automates more and more of the world around us, its most anticipated applications for marketers and advertisers are just emerging. According to a <a href=""https://www.eiuperspectives.economist.com/technology-innovation/artificial-intelligence-real-world-0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2017 Economist Intelligence Unit</a> report, 79% believe AI will make their jobs easier and more efficient. So, it’s no surprise that by 2025, the artificial intelligence market is expected to surpass $100 billion.

AI marketing is finally a reality, and everyone in the industry is clamoring to discover the possibilities...
<h4>What AI Is and What AI Isn’t</h4>
Artificial intelligence isn’t a new concept. Over the years, it has become synonymous with everything from the Terminator to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/ask-the-expert-what-does-alexa-mean-for-programmatic-advertisers-and-marketers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Alexa</a>. At its core, artificial intelligence refers to the branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines that act like humans. But AI isn’t meant to replace humans (or our jobs).

In today’s ad tech world, artificial intelligence represents a way for marketers to sift through big data in milliseconds and find insights about customers that will enhance the user experience. No longer a dream of sci-fi pop culture, AI systems and technologies have already begun to proliferate in the marketing industry.

[table id=11 /]

AI technology is quickly becoming an important factor in marketing success, so how can you take advantage in the coming years?
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Say goodbye to media planning as you know it</strong>. Instead of reaching females in their 30s on mobile devices who like cooking, you can target Sally on the device she uses most when she looks up recipes. Hours spent strategizing audiences will be a thing of the past — AI tech can tell you exactly who to target based on data from consumers' browser histories, chatbot conversations, and more.</li>
 	<li><strong>Save money with smarter bidding</strong>. Targeting truck lovers using Chrome on NFL.com isn’t worth the same price at 8 a.m. on Wednesday as it is at 7 p.m. on Sunday. Machine-learning algorithms account for these differences and vary your bid based on the context in which the ad is served, which means you’ll win more impressions at the value they are actually worth.</li>
 	<li><strong>Get closer to your customers</strong>. When you watch Netflix recommended shows, an artificial intelligence uses real-time data to predict your mood in that moment and make the right movie suggestion. The same predictive technology can be used to bring back the human touch in your ads. For instance, pairing a “chance to win” incentive with spirited users who just set their fantasy team lineup.</li>
</ol>
Ready or not, artificial intelligence is here. It’s no longer a question of if you will use AI technology but when you’ll start maximizing its potential on your campaigns.

If you’re looking for the secret to a happier workplace, a good place to start is Fortune’s Best Workplaces lists. Every year, Great Place to Work® and Fortune name the best workplaces in a variety of categories, from Millennials to parents.
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><img class=""alignleft wp-image-7103 size-medium"" title=""2017 GPTW Best Workplaces for Women logo"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GPTW-Best-Workplaces-for-Women-Badge-172x300.png"" alt=""2017 Great Place to Work Best Workplaces for Women logo"" width=""172"" height=""300"" />They recently published the 2017 Best Workplaces for Women list, which included Goodway Group coming in at #14. This was our first year participating in the survey, so while we’re not at all surprised Goodway is a great place to work, we couldn’t be more delighted to be called one of the 100 Best Workplaces for Women.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">This list comes from anonymous surveys of more than 400,000 employees from hundreds of businesses in all sectors of the economy. The surveys explored employees’ assessment of their organization’s culture, leadership, fairness, and other elements essential for a great workplace. The requirements for the award were pretty stringent, and the result of <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/working-moms-in-tech-get-best-both-worlds/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">direct feedback from women in our workforce</a>. So, we are extremely humbled by this honor and take it as an affirmation of why we are so successful in retaining employees.</p>
You might be wondering, how did we do it? The secret is ingrained in our culture.
<h4>It’s Not Just About the Perks</h4>
We’re proud to employ a team that includes remarkable women at every level of our organization. In an industry characterized as having a heavy ""<a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/02/01/goodway-group-bucks-the-bro-culture-tech"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">bro-culture</a>,"" we achieved a workforce that’s 75% female and nearly a 50/50 male-to-female executive breakdown.

Diversity is one of the key elements that drive our success, and we know it takes the hard work of each and every employee at Goodway Group to deliver the outstanding service our clients expect. To all of you, thank you for your Herculean efforts day after day; we couldn’t do it without you!

A big part of our culture is valuing and appreciating our employees as people. We support their passions, like mountain biking and international cooking, and acknowledge exceptional work. We invest time and money into effective training programs, useful benefits, and the right policies to create the perfect balance of positive energy and productivity. This means we can have fun and even allow ourselves to be silly at times, like during our lip sync battle at the annual company celebration or during our pumpkin decorating contest each October.

It also means we support the whole life of our employees, beyond the traditional 9 to 5. Generous paid time off, a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/core-values-inspired-maternity-leave-policy/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">best-in-class maternity leave</a> policy, and awesome bosses and coworkers are just the beginning. Among our highest rated benefits are a virtual work-from-home model and flexible work schedules that foster an inclusive culture for working women, mothers, and wives. This ensures <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goodway-life-make-work-from-home-work/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">working from home actually works for every family</a>. For one busy mom of four and Director of Ad Operations, this means the ability to have breakfast as a family every morning!

Research shows this approach pays off: Women are 5X more likely to plan a long-term future with their employers when they say they’re treated as full members of the team, regardless of position. But we don’t need the research to tell us it’s working — we just look at our 92% retention rate and <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Overview/Working-at-Goodway-Group-EI_IE345398.11,24.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">4.8 Glassdoor rating</a>.
<h4>Our Employees Say It Best</h4>
Our employees continually <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/employees-say-great-place-to-work/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">share their feedback and appreciation on sites like Glassdoor</a> and through surveys like the <a href=""https://reviews.greatplacetowork.com/goodway-group"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Great Place to Work profile</a>, which have helped set us apart from other companies. Here are stories from a few of our female team members of what it’s like to work at Goodway in their own words:

Football season has officially kicked off, bringing with it the <a href=""https://deadline.com/2017/09/dallas-cowboys-win-sunday-night-football-ratings-nfl-nbc-miss-america-the-orville-nbc-1202166570/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">high ratings</a> that excite networks and advertisers alike. Football advertising is an obvious win for many large national advertisers, but how can a smaller regional advertiser get in the game? We’re calling an audible and showing you how to reach football’s fans online.
<h4>TV Sync Could Be Your Breakout Player This Season</h4>
For audiences who don’t want to miss a single play, they’ll likely be multitasking online during TV commercials to find out who else is in the red zone. This is the perfect opportunity to use TV-sync tactics that use commercial triggers, like when a competitor’s brand airs on traditional TV, to provide consumers with your ads online at the same time. You can also target sports triggers and reach viewers at specific points in the game, like halftime, or after game events, like a touchdown.
<h4>Make Mobile Your Game day Go-To</h4>
Today’s on-the-go tech offers several opportunities to reach football fans checking stats from the road, the tailgate party, or the couch. You can pick up inventory within specific sports apps, like ESPN or NFL Sunday Ticket, to hit general score followers. Or you can target users by which mix of apps they have downloaded onto their phone and show them personalized ads across all their apps. For example, a competitive fanatic who has downloaded DraftKings, ESPN Fantasy Sports, and NFL Stats Lab will likely be more interested in a “chance to win” ad over a “free shipping” incentive. Finally, if you are advertising in an NFL or college football market, you can use hyperlocal mobile targeting to reach season ticket holders at the stadium on game days.
<h4>Recruit Free Agents Signing on to Social Media</h4>
With paid social advertising, you can reach users who have self-declared that they are football enthusiasts. On Facebook, you can land a pass with users who have liked their alma mater’s team page or a player fan page. Twitter allows you to advertise to users based on keywords they post like “touchdown” or “#SNF.” Snapchat is another channel to add to the playbook by targeting users bucketed into the lifestyle category “American Football Fans.”
<h4>Go for Two-point Conversion with Video Highlights and Analysis Clips</h4>
Perhaps the most exciting option, you can buy video ads against football-related content, whether it’s post-game analysis or highlight reels. Sure, it’s not the same as your ad playing at game time, but you’re still reaching users interested in rich-media football content. On YouTube, you can pick specific channels to advertise on, such as NFL’s channel, or you can target users watching videos categorized as football content.

However you choose to advertise, there are plenty of play calls that will reach your ideal football audience online and make your clients want to do a touchdown dance, at a fraction of what a TV spot costs.

You built an amazing app that actually simplifies users’ lives. Check! You made the app available on the top app stores for a wide range of mobile devices. Check! Now you can sit back and wait for the downloads to roll in ... just kidding.

After an initial launch, it is tempting to set your app live and forget it, but if you want to really drive app installs, you need to continue to innovate your search campaign so that users can find your app. The newest trick for how to get more app downloads is through Google’s <a href=""https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6247380?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Universal App campaign</a> (UAC).

Today, <a href=""https://searchengineland.com/google-universal-app-campaigns-now-delivering-50-downloads-across-network-280675"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">50% of all app installs</a> come from UACs, which means if you aren’t onboard with them already, you’re missing out! If you are new to search campaigns or if you just need to get up to speed on the latest search tech, I’ve got you covered with a few tidbits I’ve learned about how to get more app downloads with UACs.
<h4>WHAT IS A UAC?</h4>
App stores are increasingly crowded, making it more challenging than ever for marketers to get their app noticed at a mass scale. When Google’s app install campaign initially launched for AdWords, app developers and businesses could get the word out through search and YouTube networks for users to download. In-app activity goals could also be set, which was key since most users will download an app but won’t maintain engagement with it over time.

In more recent years, Google launched Universal App campaigns, which make it even easier to promote apps and enable promotions across the whole suite of Google products: search, display, YouTube, AdMob and Google Play Networks. UACs advertise your app on all four platforms at once, helping you spend smarter, increase reach and optimize effectively by pooling together your entire budget rather than slicing it into pieces as it would be if you ran four separate campaigns.

With the success of UACs, Google is moving all app-install ads under its umbrella this fall. So if you haven’t made the move yet, now is the time.
<h4>GETTING STARTED</h4>
If you are a developer or a business who wants to promote your app on a mass scale, here is how to get more app downloads using Universal App campaign ads. What you need:
<ul>
 	<li>A few lines of ad copy, up to 10 images or up to 5 YouTube videos of your app</li>
 	<li>A budget and starting bid for your ads</li>
 	<li>Geo and language targeting parameters</li>
 	<li>The in-app activity or installation goal you want to optimize toward</li>
</ul>
With these assets, Google develops ads automatically based on the network your ad delivers on and optimizes with the aim of maximizing your cost-per-install or cost-per-activity goal. This creates a great advantage for small businesses who aren’t familiar with the ins and outs of campaign setup and don’t have the bandwidth for campaign optimization.

The true power of Universal App campaigns lies in their ability to reach users not only when they are actively searching for apps but also when they are engaging with similar apps and when they are just browsing. This variety of ad formats used to promote your message means you can promote your app everywhere.
<h4>RESULTS IN ACTION</h4>
Sounds great, but don’t just take my word for it! A lot of businesses have learned how to get more app downloads from their search campaigns and seen great success. At Goodway Group, we recently used a Universal App campaign to promote an app for a medical clinic that enabled users to schedule in-house doctor visits. The campaign produced 300 app installs, beating the original goal of 200 installs, with each install costing less than 20% of the cost of a patient visit. This campaign showcased how universal app campaign strategies can be cost-effective for driving more mobile app downloads and require next to nothing in terms of maintenance time.

Another great use case for Universal App campaigns is restaurant apps that allow customers to order deliveries and to-go items through their app. Whether you are a restaurant, medical clinic or a large business, if an app is core to your offering, universal app campaigns are a hassle-free, no-brainer solution. You won’t have to worry about setting up different campaigns for different platforms or need to think about optimization strategies to better your campaign. Instead you can use the results from the campaign to fine-tune your app to make sure users are engaging with it on a consistent basis, which really is the ultimate goal.

Every brand has a specific online target audience — the customers that are the lifeblood of your business. The NFL goes after men 18 to 55 years old. Dove reaches out to women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. And Spotify hits Millennials hard.

A tried-and-true part of your marketing strategy is identifying your customer niche, but this practice shouldn’t stop after you find a primary audience segment. Whether you’re trying to attract your 100th customer or your 10,000th, identifying new audiences is a crucial part of growing your business. You may know your ideal customers now, but plan to expand your online target audience over time to continue to bring in new buyers.

Here are a few tricks I’ve learned from our recent digital campaigns that you can steal to attract a new target audience online that you may not have tapped into before.
<h4>1. Put insights to work across all your channels.</h4>
If one of your campaign tactics, like display, shows that users who self-identified as fast food enthusiasts have a higher conversion rate than your traditional healthy living audience segment, don’t be afraid to apply those learnings to test groups across other channels and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/maximizing-insight-across-reports/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">maximize your insights</a>. In this case, look for comparable foodie lifestyle and interest group segments on paid social media, Amazon and other third-party data platforms.
<h4>2. Remember, the user isn’t always the buyer.</h4>
Sometimes, it’s difficult to know who is making a purchasing decision. And in many cases, it is a joint decision. So, we recommend media strategies that target beyond the user. For instance, rather than just selling cologne specifically to men, also target the wives and girlfriends who are shopping for them.
<h4>3. People who search alike, act alike.</h4>
Reaching people interested in “running” is pretty broad. Instead, you can use <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/optimize-campaign-roi-without-touching-media/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">keyword trends and SEM tactics</a> to target shoppers who searched for similar terms to those that brought in your best online customers, such as “marathon training” and “lightweight pavement running shoes.” Uncovering trends in similar search behavior will help you expand your target audience online and reveal seasonality and geo patterns you may have not previously known.
<h4>4. Take advantage of the doppelgangers.</h4>
You’ve collected loads of data on your best customers. Now, you can use that first-party data to map common characteristics and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-party-data-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">build look-alike audiences</a> just like your best buyers through your DMP, Facebook and Amazon. When you can see that your best customers are thrill-seekers who like to travel in the fall, look-alikes take the guesswork out of targeting for haunted houses around Halloween.
<h4>5. Don’t overlook other devices used by your customers.</h4>
OK, so they may not be a totally new audience, but don’t forget there are several ways to turn your single-channel shoppers into omnichannel buyers. You can upload your email database into almost all social media platforms and find your customers there. Or you can onboard <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advance-programmatic-advertising-put-first-party-data-first/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">your first-party data</a> into an identity resolution platform to match all of their devices to their profile for better retargeting.

Even with these examples of how to find a new target audience online, the process still comes back to simple testing to pinpoint shifts in your audience preferences. That’s why it’s important to remember that understanding and growing your customer base is a dynamic process.

<h4><strong>Everyone loves to talk about themselves! Give us your career story . . . in a tweet.</strong></h4>
After over a decade in the world of front-end and UI design at ad agencies, I entered the realm of back-end programming, where you will find me to this day.
<h4>There are lots of ad tech companies to work for, so why Goodway Group?</h4>
My first memory of Goodway Group says it all. During my interview, our COO Jay shared that I was one of the first people to answer one of his most pivotal questions to his satisfaction: “What is integrity?” (Hint: It's what you do when no one is watching.)  Now, seven years later, I am still in love with this company and the folks who make it such a great place to work.
<h4><strong>If you had to describe what you do as a superpower, what would it be?</strong></h4>
Curiosity is the superpower of every successful programmer. I’m here to ask, “What if?” It’s a powerful question that’s responsible for everything from the advent of flight to the deep frying of cheesecake. Yum!
<h4>How has Goodway Group supported self-discovery in your career?</h4>
I found a new side of me thanks to the freedom that working from home has afforded me. After several years of working at home, I decided to get an Airstream travel trailer and roam the US, limited only by the bounds of the 4G network. I have met the most interesting characters and found some hidden wonders that I would never have been able to in a traditional job setting. It has taught me to be more self-sufficient, adventurous, and given me a fresh perspective on life. Everyone here pushes you to be the best version of yourself you can be — on the job and off the job. That’s why I go out of my way to do more for the company in return.
<h4><strong>What has been your greatest accomplishment at Goodway?</strong></h4>
I will never forget getting a standing ovation from the entire company when we first launched GoLive!, our dynamic content system. To have a workflow system appreciated like that was an astounding career success.
<h4><strong>Why do you care about what we do at Goodway?</strong></h4>
There are three things that make me work hard for this company: 1) the people, 2) the people, and finally, 3) the people. Also, I love a good creative ad. Seeing how creative designers and developers best utilize the tiny canvas of a banner ad is really interesting to me. The online ad world is fraught with bad experiences, and I am glad to be a force for good.
<h4><strong>If you’re working from home, how are you not tempted to watch Netflix all day?</strong></h4>
The main reason I don’t watch Netflix all day is because it would be so dull compared to the challenges and problems we solve on a daily basis.
<h4><strong>If we stopped by your house next Saturday, what would we find you doing?</strong></h4>
There is a good chance I wouldn't be there! I am an explorer by heart, and I am always out and about trying to see, learn or do something new. Although there is a possibility you might find me in the evening reading a golden age sci-fi book, playing online games with my friends or following the latest cryptocurrency news.

Today’s consumers engage with their favorite brands more than ever before. They may start a search on their desktop, compare recently emailed coupons on their laptop, check out what others are saying on social media apps, and then finally drive to a store to make a purchase. For marketers, all these touch points are critical to understanding what their customers want and need.

Tracking a consumer’s identity across these different places can be tough. So, instead, marketers have relied on targeting devices without really knowing the real person behind it. But not anymore thanks to people-based marketing.

People-based marketing is the industry’s latest buzzword, so you better know the essentials. Get all the answers you need and discover why it should be a part of your client’s media mix now.
<h4>What is People-Based Marketing?</h4>
At the most basic level, people-based marketing means gathering customer data from both offline and online sources and using that rich profile to more accurately recognize and reach customers on any device. It connects brands with real people, not audience or device groups. This means you can better target individuals with messages that matter and engage them in more meaningful ways.

One of the first people-based marketing initiatives started with the launch of Facebook Custom Audiences, which allowed advertisers to match their CRM data to Facebook user IDs for enhanced targeting. No surprise, Twitter and Google quickly followed suit with similar capabilities. Today, there are a variety of people-based marketing solutions available to advertisers beyond these early adopters, including Amazon, LiveRamp, and more. Just Google “people-based marketing solutions,” and you’ll come up with over 5 million page results!
<h4>OK, I'll bite. How Does People-Based Marketing Work?</h4>
We’ve all been followed by that ad weeks after we looked up a product online and already bought it in the store. If you’re an advertiser, you know how frustrating it can be to see marketing dollars wasted like this. People-based marketing is changing the digital ad game. Here’s how it works:

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-7291"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-Is-PBM-Upload-Icon-150x150.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />Let’s say your car dealership wants to get past customers to come back onto the lot for a year-end closeout sale. You’ll start by taking your offline customer data — like their email address, phone number, occupation and purchase history that live in your CRM or loyalty database — and upload it to our secure platform. This is called data onboarding.

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-7288"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-Is-PBM-Matched-Icon.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />We match that data to the digital info on each person — like their device IDs, browsing habits and social logins. We also anonymize any personally identifiable information in the process, so you can rest easy knowing your customers’ privacy stays protected.

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-7285"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-Is-PBM-Distribute-Icon.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />Then, we distribute the profiles to your preferred media platforms, where you’ll be able to recognize, segment and reach the exact consumers you want to target. This means instead of targeting males in their 30s who like trucks, you can reach Joe, who is a rancher with a truck lease expiring in the next 90 days.

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-7290"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-Is-PBM-Target-Icon.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />When you know who your customers are online, you can deliver more relevant ads throughout their day, no matter where they are browsing from. And those ads can be personalized, for instance, with an all-wheel drive package and increased towing capacity to make them even more relevant for Joe.

TL;DR? That’s ok. Check out our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-people-based-marketing-works/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">&lt;2-minute explainer video</a>.
<h4>It just got personal. How do I know if people-based marketing is right for my clients?</h4>
Advertisers with a robust database of offline or purchase information are the best fit for people-based marketing programs, but anyone with various data sources can build toward a successful people-based marketing campaign. Top industries for people-based marketing strategies include education, retail, travel and entertainment, automotive, health and fitness, restaurants, and CPG.
<h4>I’m not sure if I have enough data to work with. Where do I start?</h4>
Knowing if you have enough data to work with is never a black and white answer, but you can start by understanding the different types of marketing data.

[table id=19 /]

Since <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advance-programmatic-advertising-put-first-party-data-first/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">first-party data is the key</a> to a successful people-based marketing strategy, you’ll want to concentrate your efforts there. Build deeper, more meaningful first-party data by consolidating CRMs across your organization, giving customers a way to share their information during checkout, or hosting gated content on your website to drive in new leads.
<h4>I’m still on the fence. Really, why should I bother?</h4>
Over 90% of media buyers can’t be wrong. That’s the number that increased their people-based ad buys last year, according to a Signal and Econsultancy report. Oh, and it works! In fact, we’ve seen a 10x improvement in view-through ROI over standard third-party behavioral segments!

Here are three quick ways you can use people-based marketing to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-party-data-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">increase the efficiency of your marketing spend</a>.
<h4><strong><img class=""alignleft wp-image-7293"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-Is-PBM-Retargeting-Icon-150x150.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />Match Your Customers’ Devices to Their Profile for Better Retargeting: </strong></h4>
Matching your first-party data to online devices allows you to retarget individuals based on their online shopping history, internet behaviors, app downloads and more. Use these insights to turn single-channel shoppers into omnichannel buyers.
<h4><strong><img class=""alignleft wp-image-7289"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-Is-PBM-Suppression-Icon.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />Exclude Those Who Already Bought for Smarter Spending</strong>:</h4>
Sometimes, it’s not about showing more people your ads; it’s about showing the right people your ads. Eliminate wasted spend by excluding current customers from your awareness campaigns. As an added bonus, you’ll retain loyal customers by ensuring they don’t receive ads that they don’t need.
<h4><strong><img class=""alignleft wp-image-7287"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/What-Is-PBM-Look-alike-Icon.jpg"" alt="""" width=""100"" height=""100"" />Expand Your Reach with New Prospects That Look Like Your Top Buyers:</strong></h4>
Gain new customers by targeting prospects that look like your best customers. Look-alike modeling uses trends in your data to identify like-minded audience segments for more effective prospecting.

As a digital researcher, I like digging into the nitty-gritty of current industry hot topics. Right now, that’s people-based marketing. So, when my team asked me to explain why people-based marketing is so popular, I couldn’t wait to dive in.

We all know that today’s advertisers must be able to recognize and reach their customers everywhere. But with the average consumer owning more than five devices and three email addresses, it’s easier said than done ... And explaining why people-based marketing is going to change all that is easier shown than said. This is where our new <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/people-based-marketing-stat-pack-slides/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">people-based marketing stat pack</a> comes in.

The downloadable PowerPoint deck explains the benefits of using people-based marketing techniques to personalize ads so you can make the case to clients who might not be totally ready to hand over their customer data.

As a quick primer, check out my favorite stats from the deck:

Every handshake or connection your sales team achieves may not always make it into your CRM. And those that do aren’t always updated when someone makes a career move or changes their email domain.

Maintaining your CRM is a thankless job. We know it’s not easy, and now the challenge for many marketers is how to build a deeper, more meaningful customer database. Brands have realized that 1-to-1 conversations are the best way to interact with their customers and is the reason for the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/why-people-based-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">rapid growth of people-based marketing</a> in our industry. People-based marketing is a powerful way to bridge the gap between offline and online data, enabling you to act on everything you know about your customers and prospects.

I get a TON of <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-people-based-marketing-works/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">questions from clients about people-based marketing</a> and how their own data stacks up. The good news is that regardless of where your customer data comes from or the shape it’s currently in, we can always help you leverage this data, or help understand how to grow your CRM data to make your people-based marketing dreams a reality. Here are some of the questions that pop up the most:
<h4>Q: Some of my partners/clients are skeptical about the security of all this. How can I help get them onboard?</h4>
Remind your partners/clients that we strip all data of personally identifiable information (PII) when we load it into the onboarding user interface (UI), with multilayered security protocols. Also, we share all CRM data files via secure Egnyte file transfer links, and we never store data locally or email sensitive first-party data.
<h4>Q: How do I know if I have enough data to work with. Where should I start?</h4>
Knowing if you have enough data to work with is never a black and white answer, but as a general rule, the more records in your database, the better. How large the data set has to be depends on what you plan to do with it and how robust the records are. For example, let’s say you’re an online retail brand with rich customer data: purchase frequency, category, brand, style, and more. Odds are you have a record count into the hundreds of thousands. In that case, we can segment that data several different ways, and still have enough users in each segment. As a rule of thumb, we try to have at least 20k users in retargeting segments and 60k in look-alike segments. On the other hand, if you’re a local QSR franchise, you may have less than 50k records total with limited customer information in each record. In those cases, we don’t recommend carving out targeting segments because the data set gets too narrow. The end goal is to have a solid pool of users to segment against key attributes, like recent and lapsed customers for a specific product or category, so if you’re not quite there yet, keep reading, and we can help you get there.
<h4>Q: Is there a way to leverage my website to grow my customer pool?</h4>
Definitely! Leveraging your owned assets is always the best way to grow your database. One of the easiest answers for how to grow your CRM data is with a good old-fashioned lead-gen campaign. Everyone loves freebies, tips and tricks, so consider hosting gated white papers, stat packs, playbooks and webinars on your site. These types of resources are what people search for online, and by prompting users to fill out a form to access the materials, you’ll have the opportunity to capture important customer information and grow your CRM.
<h4>Q: My data is really old. How can I get more recent info about my customers?</h4>
The more you know about your customers, the more effective and targeted your marketing efforts will be. Retailers have long been collecting basic details on their customers, but the rise of ecommerce, digital loyalty programs and more have made it possible to amass a rich, current profile of your consumers. Make sure you give new and existing customers a seamless, no-fuss way to share more information during checkout, whether that’s online or in-store.
<h4>Q: My CRM is a disaster. How can I start cleaning it up?</h4>
There’s no way around it – you’re going to have to roll up your sleeves and start scrubbing. De-dups, merge records, formatting and row-by-row analysis are likely going to have to be a part of this cleansing process for existing data. And obviously while you’re doing all of this work, you’re going to want to build processes that help you avoid a similar painstaking cleanse in the future. Invest in a robust CRM that tracks meaningful customer data and uses import validation rules and other tools to keep your data clean. Wherever possible, automate the information flow into your CRM so that common incoming data is automatically formatted for consistency — like state abbreviations and phone numbers. You can also leverage third-party segments to enrich your data or overwrite incorrect information.
<h4>Q: I have an app with lots of downloads. Can I transfer those users into my database?</h4>
If you have an app, you can upload your users and match their device IDs during the onboarding process. To take your database to the next level, launch a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-to-get-more-app-downloads/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Universal App campaign</a> to drive new users to download your app and enter your system with targeted banner ad and search campaigns. But be cautious of those trying to trade an ultralow cost-per-install (CPI) for higher app store rankings. These types of campaigns often bring in low-quality traffic with extra incentives.
<h4>Q: I’ve done all of this, and I’m still coming up short. Any other tricks up your sleeve?</h4>
Some identity-resolution platforms can ingest your conversion logs and match users to online devices in order to grow your CRM data. However, these services are typically available at an additional cost and are only a one-time fix for improving your match rates rather than an ongoing solution to building out an effective customer database.

In the end, your people-based marketing efforts will only be as effective as the data that powers them. I hope these strategies on how to grow your CRM data help you boost not only the quantity of your CRM but also the quality of data points within it.

<h4>HOW PEOPLE-BASED MARKETING WORKS</h4>
People-based marketing bridges the gap between an advertiser’s offline data and the customer’s online identity. Because real people view your ads, not pixels.

It starts by taking your offline customer data — like their email address, phone number, job title and purchase history that live in your CRM — and uploading it into a secure platform, where we match it to the digital data on each person — like their device IDs, browsing habits and social logins. And we always anonymize any personally identifiable information in the process so you can rest easy knowing your customers’ privacy stays protected.
<h4>TAKE THE GUESSWORK OUT OF TARGETING</h4>
With all of your customer data connected, you take the guesswork out of targeting. Instead of reaching males in their 30s who like trucks, you target Joe, who is a rancher with a truck lease expiring in the next 90 days.

Unlock your customer’s identity online and deliver more personalized messages and relevant ads on sites they are actually visiting throughout their day, no matter which device they are browsing from. Or use your data to exclude those who already bought a new truck from the campaign and spend more efficiently. If you want to find new prospects, just build look-alike segments based on your current customers, like Joe, to persuade even more people to open, click or swipe.

Upload more customer data, focus your marketing strategy and make real connections — all with people-based marketing.

<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">Q&amp;A with Christine Yang</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><em>Christine Yang, our Atlanta-based learning and development program manager, shares how her transition from traditional media planner to digital media trader to L&amp;D has helped her master both the science and the art of digital advertising.</em></p>

<div style=""padding-top: 1px; padding-bottom: 1px;"">

<hr />

</div>
<h4>Everyone loves to talk about themselves! Give us your motto ... in a tweet.</h4>
There is nothing greater than helping people do awesome things. So, it’s no surprise that I’m in L&amp;D for a company committed to helping advertisers achieve amazing things.
<h4>There are lots of ad tech companies to work for, so why Goodway Group?</h4>
I knew in my first interview – with our COO Jay Friedman back in the day when he interviewed every person coming in at Goodway Group – that I was onto something. Coming from a traditional media agency where I was the sole resource for all things digital, I was excited to join a team that was stronger and faster in digital media than I thought was possible in the early 2000s.

But my real lasting memory of that conversation? When Jay asked me, “Which is more important: speed or process?” I can't remember what I said; but months later, I heard him share his answer with someone else, ""Speed is a factor with which you can adjust process, but they're not interchangeable. If you can sacrifice process for speed, you don't have the right process."" It's been almost 8 years since I heard that response, but the statement is more true than ever.
<h4>How has Goodway Group helped you grow?</h4>
I've been fortunate to have many roles across multiple departments and been able to provide value to Goodway in so many forms over the past seven years. I started out on the media team, progressed into several new roles on that team, and then transitioned to the L&amp;D team within the past year. All of these experiences have helped me reach personal milestones: how to be a good leader, how to be a good follower, how to be a voice for the company, and how to speak publicly in representing myself, my department, and Goodway at large.
<h4>If you had to describe what you do as a superpower, what would it be?</h4>
It’s not a super power per se, but I consider myself a bit of a mad scientist. L&amp;D requires a lot of strategy, planning and persistence. And yet, it’s also a lot of trial and error with long periods of analysis before trying the next strategy (and hoping you don’t blow up the lab in the meantime). The data, science and storytelling all require a subtle balance of art and science that only a mad scientist with the right support can truly master.
<h4>What has surprised you most about remote work and working here?</h4>
They say distance makes the heart grow fonder ... and I'd say that's true at Goodway. I have better coworker relationships in this remote environment than any other office environment I’ve ever been in, and I'd be shocked if most others at Goodway didn't say the same. Everyone is genuine; we don't stand on much ceremony here. That's the culture our president Dave and our COO Jay have instilled in the company. We don't like fluff; we just focus on awesome work and let it stand for itself. I love that about Goodway.
<h4>If you’re working from home, how are you not tempted to watch Netflix all day?</h4>
To be honest, I’m not even tempted by Netflix. Even though I am at home, it's still work that requires deep focus so I can't have a TV on in the background. To help keep the balance, I have my dedicated office space, and when I'm not in that space, I'm not at work anymore. Making that distinction and shutting my laptop down at the end of each day has helped stop me from sneaking back later to do ""one more thing.""
<h4>If we stopped by your house next Saturday, what would we find you doing?</h4>
I'm a media brain at heart — I like math, data, spreadsheets, hypothesizing and problem-solving. Anything that feels like a puzzle is like a call to arms. In fact, in my free time, my friends and I like to run around town and do escape rooms where we're locked in and usually have 60 minutes to escape by putting clues together to open locks, break keypad codes, etc. It's the thrill of entering this short period of intense, highly creative output that I enjoy and want to experience over and over.

As publishers seek to better control ad inventory and improve yield, header bidding is on the rise in the digital media industry. Yet, surprisingly, less than half of U.S. agency and marketing professionals truly understand what header bidding is, its implications, and how to make it work in their favor, according to eMarketer’s Header Bidding for Ad Buyers: What Brands, Agencies and Buy-Side Platforms Need to Know:

Our COO Jay Friedman recently contributed to this all-encompassing <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/Report/Header-Bidding-Ad-Buyers-What-Brands-Agencies-Buy-Side-Platforms-Need-Know/2002127"">report on the state of header bidding</a>, and here are 3 things every marketer should know:
<h2>1) What Is Header Bidding?</h2>
Header bidding is a common programmatic technical hack among publishers and non-Google supply-side exchanges that gives a publisher better prioritization in Google's DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP) waterfall.

It's called header bidding because publishers offer ad space to ad buyers by placing a piece of JavaScript code in their site's webpage header, the invisible space at the top of every page that stores styling – how a webpage should be rendered.

Both publishers and ad buyers can benefit from header bidding. For publishers, it can help them access more advertisers, gain greater control and efficiency, and earn more money. For ad buyers, the technique can give them access to more and higher quality ad impressions and more data to improve inventory forecasting and campaigns.
<h2>2) How Does It Work?</h2>
A publisher places a piece of JavaScript code in their webpage header. Once the code is in place, when a visitor enters the publisher's URL in their address bar, the code requests all demand sources (advertisers) within the header to place bids to display an ad in one of the various elements and locations available on the publisher's webpage. The publisher's ad server selects the highest bid for each ad impression, and the site loads in the content and advertising to appear on the page to the website visitor.
<h2>3)How It Could Affect You as a Buyer?</h2>
<strong>Ad Prices Are Rising</strong>. Due to heightened demand for inventory, the competition is getting stiffer for ad impressions, sending prices soaring. Our COO Jay Friedman said he's already seen desktop and display ads increase 100% to 200% in some cases, a good amount he attributes to header bidding's influence.

Jay also said many marketers are burying their heads in the sand, content to buy worse inventory instead of going back to clients to discuss the necessary <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/understand-rising-media-costs/"">programmatic price increases</a> needed to buy quality inventory. But these conversations are important to have so you can revise media plans and metrics to ensure digital ad campaign performance won't suffer.

<strong>Infrastructure Demands Are Increasing</strong>. Demand-side platforms (DSPs) are facing more bid requests per second (also known as weight). Since they typically work with many supply-side platforms (SSPs) at once, sometimes they get multiple bid requests for the same ad impression. Not only does this cause confusion, this duplication along with higher bid volume are driving up DSP's ad-serving costs and forcing many to pay for ad tech infrastructure upgrades to keep up. In fact, here's what Jay had to say on the topic in eMarketer's report:

<em>""There aren't any more ads for sale, but DSPs are dealing with sometimes 10 bid requests for one ad,"" said Jay Friedman, partner and COO of programmatic ad buying and planning firm Goodway Group. ""And taking into account flex ad formats, a page could generate 120 bid requests for four ads. It's out of control, and there are less than five DSPs that can shoulder this kind of weight with their infrastructure.""</em>

This will help put bid volume in perspective: According to Jay, two or three years ago, DSPs received about 1 to 2 million bid requests per second, but this may balloon up to 9 million by the end of 2017.

<strong>Auction Practices Are Changing</strong>. Private marketplace (PMP) and direct deals no longer guarantee the same privileges, especially with a greater number of publishers adopting header bidding to chase more money. You can no longer assume you will automatically get the preferential treatment and premium inventory you did before.

Also, first-price auctions are starting to replace second-price auctions, and this trend is shaking up auction rules and pricing expectations ad buyers previously followed. Having to navigate this new normal, it's much tougher for ad buyers to even know what to bid, let alone successfully strategize and optimize for great campaign performance.

With header bidding becoming more popular across our industry, now's the time to embrace change when it comes to the shifting digital media marketplace. Talk to your clients about rising CPMs, how you can get them more value. Revise your bidding strategies and ad practices on your programs. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/choosing-a-digital-ad-partner-5-questions/"">Vet your programmatic partners</a> and retain only those that are trustworthy, those that can offer the best scale, access, inventory and insights.

Imagine you’ve been tasked with creating a digital marketing campaign for a new healthy snack bar. You need to reach women ages 35-55 who are interested in a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps these women have visited yoga websites or purchased multivitamins or live in one of the nation’s most athletic cities, like Denver. How do you find these women online? Audience targeting, of course. Audience targeting is as simple to define as its two words; essentially, it’s targeting an audience or a specific group of people. For those who want a more detailed definition, it’s using data points available online to target segments of the population based on their demographics, interests and behaviors.
<h4>Types of Audience Targeting</h4>
There are various ways to target audiences using both first-party and third-party data. Here are some of the most common ways to reach a specific audience:

[table id=13 responsive=scroll responsive_breakpoint=phone/]
<h4></h4>
<h4>Finding Your Target Audience</h4>
Now that you know what audience targeting is, you might be wondering exactly how you find your target audience. Your target audience is the audience that is going to buy your product or service and become a loyal customer. If you have an established customer base but are new to audience targeting, you just need to profile your current customers. If you are a starting a new business or launching a new product, you’ll need to define your audience. Here are some suggestions on ways to find your target audience:

<strong>Profiling Current Customers</strong>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Analyze your customer data</strong> – Do you have a CRM system with customer records or a loyalty program? Depending on the information you’ve collected, you can comb through it to find trends on customer location, age or gender. You can also gather audience data from other online tools, like using Google Analytics data to find out your site’s audience, or Amazon data to find out who is buying your products on Amazon.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Survey your customers</strong> – If you have a customer base but don’t know much about them beyond an email address, try surveying them to find out some basic demographic and psychographic info. You can use SurveyMonkey or a similar tool to create a survey, and then offer your customers a small incentive to fill it out.</p>
<strong>Defining a New Audience</strong>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Ask yourself questions</strong> – At the core of determining your ideal audience, you first need to define your product or service. What problems does your product solve? Then, ask yourself who will benefit from it? For example, a health food company has debuted a new gluten-free snacks line. They are offering an audience of gluten-free and health-conscious consumers a new option for snacks that fit both their dietary restrictions and lifestyle choices.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Use research tools</strong> – Marketing research tools can be useful for uncovering industry-level audience trends. Tools like eMarketer, Simmons, IBIS World and AudienceView can provide demographic and behavioral data by vertical to help you understand overall consumer patterns for your industry.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><strong>Engage a market research firm</strong> – Investing in professional market research can help you to develop a detailed audience profile. It’s not the most economical option, but if you are rebranding or planning a big product launch, it could be worth partnering with a firm that specializes in creating audience dossiers.</p>

<h4>Audience Targeting in Programmatic</h4>
Audience targeting has always existed. Think about the location targeting that’s inherent to outdoor advertising. Posters and billboards target an audience that exists in a specific location, but outside of that location, no one will see the ad. Demographic targeting has been around for a long time as well and is still the primary way to buy audiences in traditional media channels like print, TV and radio.

The digital nature of programmatic advertising lends itself to some unique types of audience targeting that didn’t exist previously, like retargeting, people-based marketing and look-alike targeting. You know how when you are searching for a flight, you see ads that show you deals for the exact flight you were just looking for? That’s retargeting. You can target users because they visited your site and performed certain actions, or because they viewed your creative. It used to be that retargeting was only available through digital advertising because of the tracking mechanisms involved, but traditional advertising is catching up. With <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">advanced TV</a>, we can now track users as they watch TV on streaming and on-demand services and serve them retargeted ads.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-people-based-marketing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">People-based marketing</a> is another tactic that’s unique to programmatic advertising. You can upload your offline CRM data into an advertising platform and segment your audience in various ways. Let’s use a pet store as an example. You can segment users who are frequent shoppers and encourage them to sign up for a rewards program or offer them a coupon for being a loyal shopper. You can also cross-sell by targeting dog food shoppers and showing them offers to buy dog toys, or showing cat litter shoppers offers for cat food. The possibilities are truly endless when you slice and dice your customer data to create custom segments that are relevant to your business.

Exclusion targeting, also known as suppression targeting, is another way to refine your audience with people-based marketing. With exclusion targeting, you can choose audience segments you don’t want to reach out to and make sure they are blocked from seeing your ads. For example, customers who only buy dog products probably don’t have a cat, so you might want to add your dog audience as a suppression target to your cat-products-only audience campaigns and vice versa.

Finally, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-party-data-targeting/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">look-alike targeting</a> is a tactic that’s also easily available through programmatic. Look-alike targeting allows you to create a mirror audience that shares the same characteristics as your first-party data. You can create audiences that are similar to your retargeting audience, or audiences that are just like your customers in your CRM data. This targeting tactic lets you expand your audience and reach new people who have a higher likelihood of being interested in your products because they are just like the audience that already is.
<h4>Real World Results</h4>
So does audience targeting really work? Yes! We’ve seen great results across countless campaigns employing audience targeting. Our campaign for a cable marketing group was particularly successful. We employed a variety of tactics on this campaign, but one of the most effective was people-based marketing through Facebook, using the client’s offline mover data. We also created look-alike audiences based on the offline data. Our campaign resulted in an impressive 79% drop in our eCPL and 80% increase in leads over a 12-month period.

Audience targeting is a great way to reach your desired audience.

<h4>Everyone loves to talk about themselves! Give us your CAREER STory ... in a tweet.</h4>
Whether it's advertising or marketing, local or national, traditional or digital ... I've probably dabbled in it. For me, it's all about new experiences and true camaraderie.
<h4>When Friends and family ask what you do all day, how do you explain it?</h4>
I tell my friends that I work with advertisers and agencies to provide straightforward answers to their complex digital questions. Simply put, I'm a problem solver.
<h4>How has Goodway Group helped you grow?</h4>
My initial role was solely ad operations-focused but that expanded to involve client communication as I transitioned to a principal campaign operations manager this year. In each of these roles, I turned to mentors at Goodway Group who provided me not only with an opportunity but also the tools and advice to be successful. They fueled my passion for digital media and industry discovery. Beyond growing professionally, being surrounded by so many talented and knowledgeable individuals enabled me to develop many close relationships and really connect with our family culture.
<h4>What do you wish people knew about goodway group?</h4>
With coworkers from all over the country, everyone brings a different perspective to the table that helps our team grow its knowledge base. This also sparked an adventurous spirit in me! I've begun ""living on the road"" as a digital nomad since working with Goodway, and I have so many coworkers to thank for opening my eyes to this unique lifestyle!
<h4>What has surprised you most about remote work?</h4>
Working virtually is different than I ever imagined. Although we are spread out across the country, we feel so connected, and many coworkers genuinely feel like close friends. I've been most surprised  at the close-knit relationships that develop amongst people who work physically so far apart and how we all seem inspired to give our best efforts for each other. Our all-company trips feel more like a reunion than a work conference, and there is a legitimate excitement leading up to each one.
<h4>If we stopped by your house next Saturday, what would we find you doing?</h4>
I enjoy being outdoors, so I'd most likely be preparing to go do something active, like hiking, biking, boxing or anything that gets me moving and sweaty. But in the fall, it wouldn't be uncommon to find me watching a football game, touring the local brewery scene or checking out some downtown street art.

And it looks like the programmatic industry is headed for another banner year in 2018. In a recent forecast, eMarketer estimated four out of every five US digital display dollars will transact programmatically next year, totaling nearly $40 billion.

But with our new algorithm, buyers can now more precisely calculate first-price auction bids to keep clients from overpaying, and we've already seen good results, measurable eCPM and performance improvements.

In fact, it's the only programmatic firm in the ad tech market to have already addressed and adapted to this big programmatic industry shift. First-price auctions are both good and bad, good because they offer a clean slate for transparency and fairer business practices for buyers and sellers but bad because they mean having to change buying strategies, build tech, and pay more. But with our new algorithm, buyers can now more precisely calculate first-price auction bids to keep clients from overpaying, and we've already seen good results, measurable eCPM and performance improvements.",9/6/17 6:18,post,https://https://adexchanger.com/platforms/big-changes-coming-auctions-exchanges-roll-dice-first-price/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWlRjelpqRmtaVE5pWWpVMiIsInQiOiJYUXJqcklNb1dTOG41QThGTTF1T1dNNmRzUHlhcFh4WXR3cFY1NTBPaDY1dTd2UjNSTXR3ejEzTG85eFoyOG1LUlwvazEzNUpPSUFsU2NBQmVpXC9xS1Q0a0FJOFpRbHFMdkJXZXl6UG1TK0NmcCs5SzRBVXBiMmpkNEYwMWJjTlB4In0%3D,https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ad-Exchanger-Logo-Fnl.png,Ad-Exchanger-Logo-Fnl.png,/nas/content/live/prodgoodway/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ad-Exchanger-Logo-Fnl.png,11813,Ad Exchanger Logo,,,AdExchanger Ad Exchanger,https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ad-Exchanger-Logo-Fnl.png,In the News,,,,,7,JCiccarelli,marketing@goodwaygroup.com,Marketing,,big-changes-coming-auctions-exchanges-roll-dice-first-price,https://https://adexchanger.com/platforms/big-changes-coming-auctions-exchanges-roll-dice-first-price/?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiWlRjelpqRmtaVE5pWWpVMiIsInQiOiJYUXJqcklNb1dTOG41QThGTTF1T1dNNmRzUHlhcFh4WXR3cFY1NTBPaDY1dTd2UjNSTXR3ejEzTG85eFoyOG1LUlwvazEzNUpPSUFsU2NBQmVpXC9xS1Q0a0FJOFpRbHFMdkJXZXl6UG1TK0NmcCs5SzRBVXBiMmpkNEYwMWJjTlB4In0%3D,

The GRP has long been a standard advertising measurement, and it's often associated with TV buying. However, the GRP and its cousin, the TRP, can also be used to measure online media buys. The rise of streaming services allows viewers to seamlessly switch between digital and traditional media, leaving advertisers no choice but to plan multichannel campaigns. Using GRPs and TRPs in your planning can connect the dots between old school and new school. Our guide will walk you through the terms you need to know and explain how to use the measurements.

<h2>Bridging the Gap Between Traditional and Digital</h2>
Multichannel media plans are often built using GRPs and TRPs to connect both linear and digital advertising, allowing planners to create one cohesive plan. Using a standard form of measurement across traditional and digital buys allow advertisers to compare the value of traditional mediums to different online channels, such as programmatic video, advanced TV and digital audio. An impression calculator can help you convert GRPs to impressions to use on a multichannel media plan.
<h2>Best Practices</h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Utilize GRPs and TRPs for extensions to your traditional buys.</li>
 	<li>Make sure to combine your GRP and TRP goals with your reach and frequency goals.</li>
 	<li>Once you've chosen a population base, continue to use this base throughout the campaign.</li>
 	<li>Take advantage of our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/impressions-trp-calculator/"">impression calculator</a> to calculate GRPs to impressions.</li>
</ul>

Our COO Jay Friedman was quoted in this AdExchanger article about the four ways DSPs make money beyond their percentage of media and what marketers think of these nontransparent practices.

Regarding QPS rebates, Jay said, ""“As a buyer, you count on your DSP to be agnostic as to where you spend your money. If they start diverting spend, that’s unethical. That should be done with buyers’ consent and returned to the buyer.”

When asked about his feelings about discrepancy fees, Jay said, ""“If, in the natural course, some numbers are over and some are under, so be it. If the DSP has programmed its ad server to overcount such that that creates a spread for them, that is not OK.”

Lastly, he said marketers should focus on the ROI created by programmatic media buys overall and that making money isn't bad, just hidden fees are bad.

If you have ever bought anything on eBay, you are probably familiar with the second-price auction, where the winner pays the second highest bid rather than their own. For years, programmatic ad buying ran in a second-price auction format with the whole transaction happening in milliseconds. However, there has been a recent shift among many publishers to a first-price auction model, where what you bid is what you pay if you win the impression.

Bidding in a first-price auction with a second-price strategy can get expensive quickly. Yet, <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/12/14/nearly-half-both-buyers-and-sellers-struggle-understand-auction-dynamics-according"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">nearly half of buyers are still in the dark on the basic differences</a> of the first-price versus second-price auction according to The Drum. Without a clear understanding of the mechanics in play for each auction, how can you know the right price to pay to get the best value from your media?

Let’s start with clearing up a few quick terms:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>First-Price Auction</strong> – Digital buying model where if your bid wins, you pay exactly what you bid. This maximizes revenue potential for the seller.</li>
 	<li><strong>Second-Price Auction</strong> – Digital buying model where if your bid wins, you pay $0.01 above the second highest bid in the auction. In this type of auction, it is in your best interest to bid the highest amount you are willing to pay, knowing that often you will end up paying less than that amount.</li>
 	<li><strong>Header Bidding</strong> – A popular type of first-price auction where publishers place a piece of code on their webpage headers that allows a limited number of advertisers to bid on inventory outside of their primary ad server. This lets advertisers compete for premium, reserved inventory prior to or in lieu of the second-price auction.</li>
 	<li><strong>Price Floor</strong> – The minimum price a publisher will accept for its inventory. Publishers ignore all bids below that price. This, in effect, turns a second-price auction into a type of first-price auction.</li>
 	<li><strong>Clearing Price</strong> – The final price paid for an impression.</li>
</ul>

3 STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE SPEND ACROSS AUCTIONS

[/fusion_title][fusion_text]
<ol>
 	<li><a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/whats-programmatic-worth/"">Look for machine learning technologies</a> built for the new environment that can identify first-price auctions, predict price floors and adjust your bids accordingly.</li>
 	<li>Find a DSP that operates effectively in both auctions and can handle the increase in bid density.</li>
 	<li>Rather than concentrating solely on the data from bids won, regularly evaluate lost impression data as well to improve your bidding strategy.</li>

In late 2017, Apple released iOS 11, which included the new Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) feature for Safari. Then, in 2018, Apple announced an update to ITP, further limiting how advertisers can track browsing data using cookies. This is great for consumer privacy, but how will Apple's latest changes impact your advertising campaigns?
<h4>What's Changed?</h4>
For years, Safari has blocked third-party cookies on webpages, but these rules didn’t include first-party cookies or cookie trackers placed on ads. However, with the original introduction of ITP, Safari began deactivating any type of cookie designed to track users across sites after 24 hours — including first-party cookies. After the initial 24-hour tracking window, the cookie only operated as a user login. ITP also deleted tracking cookies entirely if the user didn’t visit the site for more than 30 days. By comparison, the standard cookie in Google AdWords is available for retargeting use for 30 days, and many other bid tools make them available for 90 days.

With the newest updates to ITP, the 24-hour tracking window is completely removed, meaning the cookies that many advertisers rely on for retargeting and attributing conversions to the correct campaign element will no longer be able to measure conversions on Safari at all.

Reducing the reach and tracking that dynamic ads can have on mobile devices is especially impactful for industries with long sales cycles, such as auto advertisers. By deactivating conversion tracking cookies, such as legacy DoubleClick Campaign Manager (DCM) iframe or image pixels, Safari prevents advertisers from collecting site visit and browsing behavior data to build personalized content and messaging. Plus, this doesn’t necessarily mean users will see fewer ads — just ones that are more generic and not tailored to their personal interests.

<strong>Who Could Be Impacted by ITP Changes?</strong>

<strong>Mobile campaigns running on Safari browsers will feel the greatest impact</strong> as Safari makes up <a href=""http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">50% of the mobile browser share</a>. However, the number of mobile web campaigns pales in comparison to those run in-app, meaning the overall impact on conversion reporting will be relatively limited.

<strong>Desktop campaigns running on Safari browsers will have few consequences</strong>, as <a href=""http://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america/#monthly-201708-201808"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Safari’s share on desktop is less than 10%</a>.

<strong>Mobile in-app campaigns are not affected by ITP</strong> since they do not rely on cookies for user tracking. Since mobile activity for most social media platforms happens in-app, those campaigns won’t be significantly disrupted by the change either.

<strong>Catch Up With These Terms to Know</strong>

<strong>First-Party Cookies</strong> – Data owned by the advertiser and collected on its own website. First-party cookies do helpful things, like remember your username and password automatically the next time you log in, but they are also very useful in advertising to build retargeting pools and track conversions that result from ads.

<strong>Third-Party Cookies</strong> – Data owned and collected by an outside company. An easy way to spot third-party cookies is the domain name doesn’t match the website the user is currently visiting. Third-party data is most commonly used in behavioral targeting campaigns.

<strong>Google Tag Manager (GTM)</strong> – A tool that allows marketers to add and update website tags from an external platform, rather than editing their website code directly.

<strong>Global Site Tags</strong> – A new JavaScript tag developed by Google that allows advertisers to send website conversion data to AdWords, DoubleClick, and Google Analytics. Global site tags are ITP-compliant.

<h4>Quick Tips for Advertisers</h4>
As any digital media buyer will tell you, data on the websites people visit and how they behave on different sites is critical to building a long-term successful campaign. Fortunately, we’re one step ahead to ensure your campaigns stay on track.
<ol>
 	<li>If you’re seeing campaign conversions drop and you suspect it might be due to ITP, do an analysis comparing data from your CRM or other marketing management tools to see if it follows a similar trend. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/why-your-marketing-reports-dont-match/"">While data between platforms will never match 100%</a>, it often follows similar trends.</li>
 	<li>If you are using legacy DCM iframe or image pixels to track conversions on your site, then you need to replace them with a GTM container tag — unless you have already implemented the pixels via GTM, in which case you are all set. When implementing pixels via GTM, iframe and image DCM pixels are automatically converted into ITP-compliant global site tags, so you will be able to continue tracking conversions coming in from Safari browsers.</li>
 	<li>Google recently implemented global site tags, which are ITP-compliant and streamline website tagging for all Google products. If you are using a tag manager other than GTM, you need to implement global site tags to continue to send website conversion data to platforms like AdWords and Google Analytics. Otherwise, you may see a drop in your conversion data moving forward.</li>
 	<li>Take advantage of the growth of in-app traffic and expand your media strategy beyond the browser to limit your exposure to ITP. And if your brand has an app, make sure you are <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-to-get-more-app-downloads/"">maximizing downloads with the latest strategies</a>.</li>

Earlier this year, Facebook announced it was making changes to its Newsfeed algorithm to prioritize friends’ content over passive brand and publisher posts. This news was all the talk at <a href=""https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/smmworld/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Social Media Marketing World</a> earlier this month.

In the past, many used organic social media as a cheap way to raise brand awareness or drive traffic to a brand site. But now, as Facebook’s Newsfeed begins to limit organic content from publishers, some marketers find themselves in a quandary. How can you effectively use social media to market your products moving forward?

The answer: It’s time to put real ad dollars behind your content.

It’s estimated that each Facebook user is eligible to be shown up to 1,500 different pieces of content daily but only sees about 300. The Facebook Newsfeed algorithm works to ensure users are getting a relevant experience by measuring thousands of factors to cut through the noise. Now, the algorithm will prioritize posts expected to spark conversation and show these higher in the feed.

With the recent update, it’s predicted that posts from friends and family will take priority over brands and businesses, thus limiting the organic brand reach. While brands can expect to see decreased organic reach, Facebook will not make drastic changes to its ad algorithm, meaning paid social content won’t be impacted by these changes.

If this all sounds familiar, it’s because last year’s theme coming out of Social Media Marketing World was also about having to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/social-marketing-world-advertising-trends/"">put paid dollars behind your content</a>. But then there were still hacks to get Facebook’s algorithm to prioritize your organic posts in the Newsfeed for free, such as using Facebook Live. Moving forward, marketers must focus on organic posts that drive real engagement, supported by paid social media ads to expand brand reach.

<h4>Engagement Is the Way to Go</h4>
Another hot topic at Social Media Marketing World was the importance of having an engaged audience. Followers, likes, comments and shares are integral parts of a social media presence but are only vanity metrics. There’s no denying that your number of followers comes with a sense of pride, but that’s merely the tip of the social media advertising iceberg.

Harvard Business Review recently conducted over 20 experiments to explore if <a href=""https://hbr.org/2017/03/whats-the-value-of-a-like"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">liking a brand on Facebook makes consumers more likely to purchase</a>. A/B tests ranging in complexity and category consistently found that liking a brand on Facebook doesn’t change behavior or increase purchasing among consumers.

Having tons of followers is nice, but ultimately, how do you quantify metrics to justify your media spend?

When it comes to putting advertising dollars behind social media, we always recommend incorporating a return on ad spend (ROAS) metric to your reporting. To do so, focus on conversions, engagements and brand awareness to help quantify the value of the spend. At Goodway Group, we often utilize cost per click, cost per conversion and video viewership to tie social metrics back to a business objective where the user took an action.

Because what’s more valuable: 50,000 users converting and driving business to your bottom line or 500,000 passive followers who may or may not engage with your brand?

<h4>It’s not All About Facebook</h4>
Sure, Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla of social media, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only player in the game. <a href=""https://www.imediaconnection.com/articles/editorial/2017/1703-articles/170327-how-to-find-a-social-platform-for-every-marketer/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Many other social media platforms offer great reach and ad options</a>, but some, such as Pinterest and LinkedIn, are quickly upgrading their advertising capabilities as well to become just as robust as Facebook.

Pinterest is great for top funnel advertising since users typically save Pins of interest and revisit them down the road when they’re ready to convert. Last year, Pinterest introduced multiple new advertising products, including expanding their search ads, autoplay video pins and additional interest targeting. Their advertising platform continues to grow with new functionality, such as customized reporting and conversion settings. Plus, they’ve <a href=""https://business.pinterest.com/sub/business/business-infographic-download/pinterest-possibilites-planner-2018.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">released new tools</a> to help with planning out future campaigns based on historical data.

For LinkedIn, 2018 is poised to be a big growth year. Their road map of product releases for the year will really expand <a href=""https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/marketing-solutions-2018?#"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">LinkedIn’s advertising offerings</a>. Such releases include video and dynamic ads, objective-based advertising, third-party impression tracking and look-alike targeting.

There is a social media platform out there for every advertiser. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/contact/"">Find out what’s right for your brand</a>.

With the industry’s efforts to fight fraud and improve transparency gaining overwhelming momentum, the first question your advertisers are likely to ask is, “Are my campaigns protected?”

It’s a fair question for most, but not one our partners lose sleep over. That’s because the Trustworthy Accountability Group (TAG) just released its <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tag-announces-2018-seal-recertification-for-anti-fraud-anti-piracy-anti-malware-transparency-programs-300618033.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2018 list of Inventory Quality Guidelines (IQG)-certified companies</a>, and Goodway Group is among the recipients for the third year in a row!

<h4>What is TAG?</h4>
For those who aren’t familiar, <a href=""https://www.tagtoday.net/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">TAG is a global certification program dedicated to fighting fraud</a>, combating malware, preventing Internet piracy, and promoting transparency in the digital advertising supply chain.

TAG’s certification program gives consumers and advertisers peace of mind that they can trust the sites, publishers and vendors they’re working with.

 	<li><strong>Run on real inventory</strong>.</li>
</ol>
Real, quality video inventory has long been in scarce supply on the open exchange, and now it’s even more so. Up until now, buyers have only been able to gauge whether inventory is real based on indicators like price and player size. With the Authorized Dealer Sellers (ads.txt) launch in May 2017 – the Interactive Advertising Bureau’s (IAB’s) Tech Lab initiative to combat counterfeit inventory and increase transparency in the programmatic advertising ecosystem – advertisers and marketers now have another tool in their arsenal to root out ad fraud.

Danielle, our in-house expert, talks about its value in eMarketer’s report: “[<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/?s=ads.txt"">Ads.txt</a>] allows publishers to declare who their authorizers are, so then as buyers we can choose to just buy from those sources. That one action alone is really going to help clean up some of the fraud we’re seeing today.”

To reduce the risk of buying fraudulent inventory, here are some steps you can take: Be wary of cheap inventory on the open exchange. If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Pick your website placements carefully or consider going with PMP deals or direct placements. And keep a whitelist of the sites you want to run on, and a blacklist of the sites you don’t.

 	<li><strong>Match your creative to your platform to your audience</strong>.</li>
</ol>
Before you craft your creative, you’ll want to know the end before you begin. Do your research and learn about all your video advertising platforms and your audience’s behavior on these platforms first. With the ever-increasing video platforms, types and formats, you’ll likely need a lot of permutations to make your message effective.

Don’t auto-play your ads in case viewers are on their phones or in situations where they have to be quiet. Auto-playing with sound will annoy your customers and is misguided given today’s media consumption habits. Subtitles are a nice quiet way to get your message across easily.

And remember to set a frequency cap. No matter how innovative or entertaining your videos are, you want them to stay fresh. You want viewers to have a good experience, not feel negatively about your brand because they must suffer through watching them over and over.

Per Ad Age, 33% of viewers will stop watching a video after 30 seconds, 45% by one minute, and 60% by 2 minutes. It’s clear timing is key when it comes to video advertising.

You can’t repurpose a 30-second TV spot and call it done. It just won’t work in digital. Even the 15-second spot struggles, especially as attention spans continue to shrink.

Realistically, you’ve got 5 seconds of storytelling max so make the most of it: Showcase your brand and get your message out there before someone skips your ad.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" dimension_margin="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text]

 	<li><strong>Increase your ad value</strong>.</li>
</ol>
Before going live with your video ads, be sure your customers and prospects can find them.

Include keywords and titles and descriptions when naming your video files and add video tags so they’re easily searchable. This will go a long way. The more metadata you can include in your video content, the better it can be searched and monetized. If your video ads rank higher in search results, you have the potential to reach a much larger audience effortlessly. And if you include links in the videos so your customers can email, embed or share your videos easily on social media, this could give you a lot of unexpected free exposure.

After you go live, keep gathering your first-, second- and third-party data to gain new insights. Keep doing your legwork. Test your video advertising executions and pore over the analytics to determine the top performers. Then optimize based on what is winning to further boost your video campaign to succeed, and do this often since the industry is always changing.

In the wake of the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook revealed several upcoming adjustments to how it handles user information. Namely, Facebook’s third-party data changes include cutting data brokers out of their ad targeting platform and shutting down its Partner Categories solution.

These changes may lead to enhanced consumer privacy, but how will they impact your advertising campaigns?

[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text]
<h4><strong>What is Cambridge Analytica and why should you care?</strong></h4>
Cambridge Analytica is a data analytics company which helps political campaigns hyper-target voters online. In mid-March, allegations that Cambridge Analytica acquired data on 50 million Facebook users without their consent appeared in <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Guardian</a> and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The New York Times</a>, causing <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/suspending-cambridge-analytica/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Facebook to suspend Cambridge Analytica</a> from buying ads or accessing Facebook data.

The news instantly pushed Facebook’s data practices into the limelight. In response to public concerns about protecting their personal information, Facebook announced it will stop using data from third-party providers and will limit how much data it makes available to advertisers buying hyper-targeted ads.

Third-party data companies offer purchase data – like brand preferences and shopping habits – to advertisers so they can target their brands to high-interest users and households. For instance, data from a loyalty card program at a grocery store could identify coffee drinkers from tea enthusiasts or even, those who buy Folgers every week from occasional Maxwell House shoppers.

Denying third-party data sources access to Facebook may initially limit some advertisers’ targeting options. For companies that do not track their own customer data, like small businesses or brick-and-mortar retailers, this third-party data has been a go-to resource for audience targeting. However, Facebook’s own data on users is as robust as many third-party providers, so we expect many marketers will simply shift their targeting to Facebook’s audience selection tools.

<h4>Why is Facebook shutting down Partner Categories?</h4>
Partner Categories launched in 2013 as a way for advertisers to leverage third-party consumer data and more effectively target people that buy their products directly from the Facebook Ads Manager. With Partner Categories, you can target people based on very specific attributes and behaviors, such as home ownership, household income, browsing preferences and product loyalty, similar to the example above.

In an effort to win back consumer trust, <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-limits-how-advertisers-can-target-you/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Facebook announced plans to phase out Partner Categories</a> by October 1, 2018. However, you can still target using your own first-party customer data via Custom Audiences. In order to give advertisers time to adjust their targeting strategy to Facebook’s third-party data changes, the last day to create new or edit existing Partner Categories campaigns is June 30, and the campaigns can run until September 30, 2018.

While shutting down Partner Categories may seem like a natural response to the situation, it doesn’t actually address the privacy and data issues that came out of the Cambridge Analytica event. The problem with Cambridge Analytica was Facebook shared user data they were not supposed to; it was not about the legitimacy of the third-party data coming into the platform. Shutting down Partner Categories and banning external data from coming into Facebook is a knee-jerk reaction that doesn’t really solve the crux of the problem. So we expect to hear more from Facebook in the coming weeks about their plans to address the deeper data issues.

<h4>How can you update your targeting strategy now?</h4>
If you relied on Facebook’s third-party data in the past, here are three ways to restructure your targeting to continue to reach customers in the future.

[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text]
<h4><strong>1.</strong> <strong>PUT YOUR FIRST-PARTY DATA FIRST</strong></h4>
Remember, Custom Audiences aren’t affected by Facebook’s recent changes. You can still upload your own customer data into Facebook to use in ad campaigns. This includes <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/people-based-marketing-grow-crm-data/"">data you collect from your CRM</a>, website, loyalty programs, mobile app, etc. If you aren’t already retargeting your customers on Facebook, now is the time to start.

Or if you are short on first-party customer data, you can use Facebook’s audience selection tools to target the people who are right for your products. Using what you know about your customers, like their age, location and interests, you can narrow or broaden your audience based on Facebook’s filters as you like.

[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text]
<h4><strong>2. BUILD LOOK-ALIKE AUDIENCES BASED ON YOUR BEST CUSTOMERS</strong></h4>
If you collect data on your customers, prioritize the segmentation of that data so you can map your best buyers for look-alike modeling. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-people-based-marketing/"">Look-alike modeling</a> uses trends in your data to identify like-minded audience segments for more effective prospecting.

This means you can reach new people who have a higher likelihood of being interested in your products because they are just like the audience that already is. For instance, when you can see that your best customers are thrill-seekers who like to travel in the fall, look-alikes take the guesswork out of regional targeting for haunted houses around Halloween.

<h4>3. GET CREATIVE WITH YOUR CREATIVE</h4>
Showing ads based on an individual’s interests and needs is a must. Build targeting groups based on what products or pages people are visiting on your website. Then deliver <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/facebook-create-ad-dynamic-ads"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Dynamic Ads</a> that capitalize on that information.

Show visitors who recently viewed a product, abandoned their cart, or added something to their wish list ads featuring that specific product and its availability. Not only are these ads more personally relevant, they also expedite the buying process by cutting down on unnecessary searching and clicks in the path to purchase.

With all the news surrounding <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/facebooks-third-party-data-changes/"">Cambridge Analytica and Facebook’s third-party data changes</a>, concern for consumer privacy is at an all-time high. You know protecting your customers is the right thing to do, but knowing the best way to keep your customers’ data safe can be difficult, especially if you don’t know the ins and outs of privacy policy best practices.

Our quick Q&amp;A will walk you through the terms you need to know and lay out three tips for protecting your customer data.

<h4>Q: What is Personally Identifiable Information (PII)?</h4>
A: PII is data used to identify a particular person, like their name or email address. PII is extremely useful for marketers who want to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">better segment, target and advertise to customers</a>. This information helps you identify individuals online so you can apply more relevant messaging to your ads.

Common examples of PII data include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
 	<li>Full Name, Maiden Name or Alias</li>
 	<li>Social Security Number, Passport Number or Driver’s License Number</li>
 	<li>Bank Account Number or Credit Card Number</li>
 	<li>Street Address or Email Address</li>
 	<li>Phone Number, Personal IP Address or Personal MAC Address</li>
</ul>

<h4>Q: What isn’t considered PII?</h4>
A: Some information on its own doesn’t constitute as PII since more than one person could share that same trait. For example, your birthday or hometown is likely shared by hundreds of thousands of individuals. Unless that data accompanies additional information on a specific individual, it isn’t considered PII.

As a result, most guidelines do not consider these items PII on their own:
<ul>
 	<li>Birth Date, Place of Birth or Current Geographic Location</li>
 	<li>Business Phone Number or Business Mailing Address</li>
 	<li>Race or Religious Indicator</li>
 	<li>Employment, Medical or Educational Background</li>
</ul>

<h4>Q: Why do you need to protect your customers’ PII?</h4>
A: Any information that your company stores on customers needs to be properly protected. Many laws are in place to ensure marketers protect their customers’ personal data from loss, unauthorized access or theft. One of the most common concerns is a data breach in which thieves piece together a person’s PII to steal their identity. Thus, misusing or compromising your customers’ personal data can carry a heavy financial cost and significantly damage your company’s reputation.

But protecting your customers is about more than avoiding penalties. At the core, it’s about your moral and corporate responsibility to respect the rights and privacy of individuals. Safeguarding customer information needs to be right up there with quality assurance and eco-friendly initiatives. And if you treat customer data like it’s your own, you’ll only amplify the trust in your relationships.

<h4>Q: How can you better protect your customer data?</h4>
A: There are several techniques and technologies available for protecting your customer data. If the spotlight is on your data processes, start with these three tips to make better decisions when it comes to protecting your customer data —

<strong>1. Use a Secure File Server, not Email</strong>

Never share customer files containing PII data through email. Instead, leverage a secure online file server to share your customer data with any agencies, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-people-based-marketing-works/"">people-based marketing</a> systems or ad platforms necessary. Also, make sure your partners anonymize the uploaded data through a secure hashing process for further protection.

<strong>2. Safeguard Access from External and Internal Threats</strong>

Set up physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect files containing personal information. For example, only use accredited software and technologies to protect against unauthorized access to your systems. Also, restrict internal access of PII data files to only those who need access to execute your advertising or marketing campaigns.

<strong>3. Limit Your Exposure</strong>

Taking your customers’ privacy seriously is an ongoing process. Set up checkpoints to audit your PII data processes throughout the year. And limit exposure by destroying any unnecessary files containing personal information. Also, ensure any vendors who have access to your customer data adhere to your standards or follow similar guidelines. And always avoid sharing any data with unverified third parties.

With two new industry-first algorithms incorporated into our RealValue Advertising Platform, we now have improved average campaign lift to 26 percent over a control.

The first is a dimensional bidding algorithm, which handles our supply path optimization so campaigns can consider two variables during the bidding process to get the best combination of site, exchange price and performance. The second is a predictive performance modeling algorithm that will allow regional advertisers to predict the best price and performance elements for local campaigns right from the start, without the need for any campaign data.

In addition to these new features, what makes our RealValue Advertising Platform better is that we take into account every ad a consumer sees for optimization, which isn't the industry norm, and we also have the full gamut of pre- and post-bid technology to support campaign performance from start to finish.

Have you ever been followed across the Internet by an ad after you looked up a product online? This phenomenon highlights the power of pixel tracking.

Pixel tracking is one of the primary ways marketers identify people who visited their website to retarget them with ads in the future, but explaining to clients how it happens is complicated. Before you pull up a lengthy PowerPoint deck and flowchart, consider a faster way to show them how pixel tracking works.

In under nine minutes, our latest video explains what a pixel is, how it works and why it can impact campaign success. Watch now:

<em>Cookie</em>: This is a piece of code saved in your browser that websites use to help identify you from the millions of other people checking out that same website.

<em>Pixel</em>: This is a piece of code companies add onto their website that places a cookie on the browser of anyone who completes a certain action, like visiting a product page or watching a product demo.

<em>Container Tag</em>: This is a tool to add lots of different types of pixels onto a website with one piece of code.

<strong>Pixel Tracking Uses</strong>

<em>Conversion Tracking</em>: A pixel fires when a visitor takes a specific action, like adding a product to their shopping cart, looking up in-store hours, or getting directions to a specific store location. This helps you track the number of users who converted.

<em>Retargeting</em>: Pixels placed on specific pages allow you to group visitors by interest or product. Then, you can set up a retargeting campaign and advertise to those specific users with more relevant messaging and creative.

<strong>Why It Matters</strong>

There are three primary benefits to using pixels:

1.       <em>Capture customer behaviors</em> - If someone clicks on your ad, you can track where they go on your site after the landing page.

2.       <em>Enhance campaign optimization</em> - Knowing which elements of your media plan are working best means you can optimize toward them.

3.       <em>Maximize your media spend</em> – Pixels let you analyze everything on a cost-per or conversion-rate basis so you know where your media is making the biggest impact.

Over the past year, we’ve shared <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">practical tips to improve your online targeting</a>, answered your top <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/facebooks-third-party-data-changes/"">Cambridge Analytica questions</a>, and explained what you can do to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/social-marketing-world-newsfeed-changes/"">stay ahead of Facebook’s recent newsfeed changes</a>. But we still get tons of questions from clients about how they can drive even more performance on their Facebook ad campaigns. So this time, I want to try something different.

We recently worked with a national home goods chain that had a solid Facebook following, but they wanted to use social media to build more than brand awareness. They were searching for a way to use paid social ads to drive real sales, specifically in their online store. With all the buzz surrounding <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-people-based-marketing-works/"">people-based marketing</a>, we knew it could improve their paid social strategy and prove Facebook ads really work.

Because this Facebook ad campaign was so widely successful – bringing in over $1.2 million in revenue in a single month at the peak of the campaign – I want to share some of the key takeaways from our experience that you can actually implement on your next Facebook ad campaign.

<strong>Don’t Forget to Layer On Your First-Party Data Segments</strong>

Nothing is more powerful than your own customer data. Yet, many advertisers abandon their <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">first-party customer data</a> when building their social media marketing strategy.

Facebook ads are cost-effective and the targeting options are so diverse that many marketers simply forget to layer on their most meaningful data. But with people-based marketing, you can import your CRM, mobile app users, or other first-party data segments to target them on social media across all of their devices, increasing your precision and efficiency.

Not surprisingly, we recommended combining Facebook targeting with people-based marketing strategies to ensure our home goods client reached high-interest prospects. The Facebook ad campaign targeted home organization interest groups with above average household incomes and a custom audience segment comprised of first-party data anonymized and imported into Facebook for retargeting. The custom audience segment featured the brand’s top 30% of spenders, meaning those who have shown high conversion rates in the past. Tapping into these high-value spenders from their own data proved successful and produced a $5 higher ROAS than the general interest groups.

<strong>Use Look-alikes to Expand Your Social Prospecting Pool</strong>

Look-alikes are people who share the same interests, demographics, and behaviors as your best customers, in other other words, a custom audience of users that have shared traits as those in your CRM list. Building look-alike audiences off your current customers is a great way to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-tricks-discover-new-target-audience-online/"">expand your prospecting pool</a> because you can reach new people who have a higher likelihood of being interested in your products since they are just like the audience that already is.

Because the resulting look-alike audience is based on the CRM segment you create, it’s important to think strategically about which factors to include. The objective is to uncover your audience segments that are most relevant for your Facebook ad campaign goals. For our home goods client, we focused on traits from the brand’s top 30% of spenders for the look-alike modeling within Facebook since our goal was to drive purchases.

<strong>Think Beyond Brand Awareness and Set ROAS Goals</strong>

There are a lot of metrics companies like to use to determine a paid social media campaign’s success, but most center around driving brand awareness – reach, new followers, likes, etc. These metrics are important, but when it comes to e-commerce, nothing beats return on ad spend (ROAS).

ROAS gives a quick look into whether certain types of ads or audiences are worth the money that is spent on them by tracking the actual revenue generated from advertising dollars. Typically, we do this by placing a revenue pixel on a site’s purchase confirmation page. Once activated, the pixel passes the exact amount spent back to Facebook, making it easy to attribute sales to the correct ad or audience source.

What’s more, we can use that information to better optimize performance mid-flight and amplify the campaign’s success. For instance, our analysts saw that shopping cart abandoners produced the highest ROAS for our home goods Facebook ad campaign, so they shifted more budget to that group in the latter months of the campaign and drove even better ad performance.

Ultimately, the Facebook ad campaign delivered impressive results — culminating with every $1 spent on advertising bringing in an average $34.70 in sales. If you want to get results like these, it’s important to leverage people-based marketing across all of your advertising channels, including your social media strategy.

One of the toughest challenges advertisers face is keeping up with the ever-evolving technology landscape. Most recently, how advertisers collect and share consumer data online has been called into question in the European Union (EU).

A new data privacy law, known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect May 25, 2018, and is the latest effort to give people more control over their digital data and how it’s used. This is great for consumer privacy, but how will it impact your advertising?

Although hotly debated, the GDPR does not signify the end of digital advertising in the EU. However, it will certainly have an <a href=""https://digiday.com/hot-topic/gdpr-impact/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">influence on the entire digital ad industry</a>, not just EU-based organizations. So what is the GDPR, who does it impact, and what should you consider to protect your campaigns?

You have your demographic and behavioral data, the right targeting tools, your omnichannel digital media strategy and eye-catching creative. But in <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/customer-experience-2018"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer’s Customer Experience 2018 report</a>, researchers discovered one thing you may be missing to truly personalize your digital marketing campaigns and elevate your customer experience: customer intent.

Our COO Jay Friedman, one of the industry experts featured in the report, said: “Creating the content at scale is not the problem. The problem is, what are we creating? Who’s going to think about the psychology behind how the image or the copy will move someone?”

Who? Not many. eMarketer found only 11% of senior marketers in North America said they currently use intent analysis in their audience segmentation strategy:

But beyond knowing search history and past purchases, you need to know your customers and prospects psychological motivations and emotional triggers behind why they want to buy (or not) from you – only then can you anticipate their needs and be right there with them at every touch point along their buying journey.

Though discovering customer intent can be elusive, follow this 6-step action plan, and with some old-fashioned legwork and organizational housekeeping, you’ll learn <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">what makes your customers tick</a> and how to craft messaging for them that will truly resonate:

<ol>
 	<li><strong>Get some field experience</strong>: Depending on your industry, spend more time at your brick-and-mortar stores or auto dealerships. Being around consumers, observing both their spoken and non-spoken behaviors, during the buying process is a good way to learn how to improve and tie together your digital and offline marketing efforts.</li>
 	<li> <strong>Increase consumer communication</strong>: Talk to a variety of customers, non-customers and prospects face-to-face, over the phone and through surveys on a regular basis to learn about their interests and priorities, their wants and fears, their pressures and obstacles, their dreams and aspirations. Consider even embedding surveys in the buying process to get instant feedback at every stage of the buying journey. If these sound like tough tasks, consider offering people an incentive in exchange for their feedback and time. These methods will give you a more well-rounded view of your audience and teach you how to position your product or service as the cure they need.</li>
 	<li><strong>Build customer relationships</strong>: Offer customer-service channels so you can dialogue with and make meaningful connections with your customers. And listen closely to what they have to say on social media. What’s your community talking about? What’s important to them? What are the trends and themes? Take note of it all, and even how they speak. Doing this will give you a well of ideas on what to address in your content marketing and what wording to use to make your audience feel you’re talking directly to them.</li>
 	<li><strong>Get back to the basics</strong>: Have a clear plan to reach and engage your customers and make customer service a priority by responding and resolving issues quickly. Create an effective, professional website, with an equally nice desktop and mobile experience, which positions you as an expert in your field. Let your audience take the lead and guide your business decisions. These business basics sound simple but can go a long way in making happy customers who are enthusiastic about opening up to you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Put your business in order</strong>: Are your systems and software fragmented? Are your corporate departments and outside partners always on the same page?  If not, you could encounter this scenario: “You’ve got separate creative and media agencies, and that right there is a total killer,” said our COO Jay Friedman. “How you set up a campaign, just from an operational media standpoint, is going to vary dramatically based on the creative.” To align campaign media and creative, or successfully meet any other goal you’re striving for, ensure your customer data is accessible and all in one place, not siloed and scattered across your organization.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gather more data</strong>: Lastly, with the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-the-gdpr-and-are-you-ready/"">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> in effect, third-party data may become more restricted and expensive. As a result, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-party-data-targeting/"">gathering your own first-party data</a> and acting on it are even more important now. If you offer your customers and prospects the right messaging, incentives and experiences they want to see and need, they’ll likely continually offer more insights to enrich your business.</li>

<h4>UTM CODE BASICS</h4>
<strong>What is a UTM code?</strong>

A UTM (Urchin Tracking Module) code, sometimes referred to as a “campaign link tag,” is a simple piece of code attached to a URL to track its marketing performance.

<strong>How does it work?</strong>

UTM codes allow you to identify several campaign elements within your link, including the source of the ad, ad medium (i.e., type of ad) and the campaign name. When a user clicks the link, Google Analytics tracks the data to help you see which campaigns or factors are performing best. However, it is important to know that UTM codes do not track post-impression data. (See more on this below.)

<strong>Why should you bother using UTM codes?</strong>

You can use UTM codes to track campaigns rather than creating custom landing pages for each campaign or vanity URL. This will save you tons of time in setting up and launching your campaigns.

<h4>Setting Up Your UTM Codes</h4>
Before you jump into building your own UTM codes, check out these seven tips to avoid headaches and error down the road.
<ol>
 	<li style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Plan Your Campaign</strong>: Decide how you want to organize campaign data before creating UTM codes since you can’t adjust the data once it’s in Google Analytics. Consider questions like
<ul>
 	<li>What is the URL you are going to convert?</li>
 	<li>Who would you like to put as the traffic source?</li>
 	<li>What types of media and ad sizes are you using?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Identify Your Source, Medium and Campaign</strong>: Use creative click-through URL(s) when building your UTM codes. To ensure traffic sources are properly identified, list the party responsible for the traffic in the source parameter and something unique about the campaign in the campaign parameter. For example, you might list your source as “bing” and identify the campaign as your “holiday sale” promotion. The medium parameter is crucial for traffic categorization and attribution within Google Analytics, so be sure to only use Google’s predefined <a href=""https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3297892?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">keywords</a> for that (note: keywords are case-sensitive). Also, if you are using the Google Analytics 360 Suite, traffic from DoubleClick Bid Manager (DCM) is organized without the use of UTM codes.
<ul>
 	<li>Source: bing</li>
 	<li>Medium: display</li>
 	<li>Campaign: holiday sale</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Add Additional Parameters, if Necessary</strong>: The more granular you get, the harder it will be to see the big picture of how your campaign is performing. Include additional parameters, such as content (example: ad size) and campaign term (example: paid keywords), only if you need the extra granularity.
<ul>
 	<li>Campaign Term: luxury watches</li>
 	<li>Campaign Content: 300×600</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Use a Custom UTM Builder</strong>: To prevent errors, use an online UTM builder or manually check that the “?” is at the end of the original URL and the “&amp;” is in between each parameter.
<ul>
 	<li>https://www.website.com<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">?</span>utm_source=bing<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">&amp;</span>utm_
medium=display<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">&amp;</span>utm_content=300×600<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">&amp;</span>utm_
campaign=holiday%20sale<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">&amp;</span>utm_term=luxury%20watches</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Bucket Your UTM Codes</strong>: Instead of breaking out every individual creative, consider creating UTM codes around a shared trait to reduce the total number of UTM codes required. For example, if you have three different 300×250 size ads (promoA, promoB, promoC) and three different creative versions for each ad (one green, one red, one blue) and all are pointing to the same destination, build UTM codes using a shared trait, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>300×250, promo_,  or [color]</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Check Your UTM for PII</strong>: Do not include any Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in your UTM codes, such as your name or address
<ul>
 	<li>https://www.website.com?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_
medium=display&amp;utm_content=300×600&amp;utm_
campaign=<span style=""color: #ff0000;"">Andy%20Wright</span>&amp;utm_term=luxury%20watches</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li style=""margin-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Allow Manual Tagging, If Applicable</strong>: If you want custom UTM codes to take precedence over auto-tagging, you must change your preferences within the property settings of Google Analytics. But if you linked your Google AdWords account to Google Analytics and enabled auto-tagging, then you do not need UTMs for your AdWords creative. To change your settings, select the checkbox for:
<ul>
 	<li>Allow manual tagging (UTM values) to override auto-tagging (GCLID values) for AdWords and DoubleClick Search integration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>HOW TO INTERPRET UTM CODE DATA</h4>
Remember, UTM codes don’t track post-impression data like some of your other media platforms. This means <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/why-your-marketing-reports-dont-match/"">your Google Analytics data might not match perfectly back to other reports</a> you may be looking at. So knowing how to interpret the data generated from UTM codes is important.

For example, a media-buying platform will usually count two types of conversions: conversions that happened immediately following an ad click (post-click) and conversions that happened later on after only viewing an ad (post-impression). Google Analytics tracks the former (post-click), which means your conversions may look inconsistent between the two platforms due to differences in tracking and counting methodology.

You may also see discrepancies in clicks due to page-load timings – if a user backs out of page before all separate media, serving and analytics platforms have the opportunity to count the click, it may result in the first-served platforms counting the clicks and the last-served platforms missing out.

Cookie blockers, setup mistakes, last-click attribution methodologies, and other errors can also impact how different systems interpret whether or not an action took place. You need to understand <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/why-your-marketing-reports-dont-match/"">what each platform can and can’t track</a> to justify any gaps between reports.

We’re here to help you make sense of all the data and maximize your insights to improve your marketing strategy. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/contact/"">Let us help</a> break it down so you can move from a state of analysis paralysis to a position of modern marketing bliss.

Unsafe content. Fake news. Russian meddling. Privacy breaches. With the flurry of recent Facebook scandals and changes, is it business as usual for Facebook marketers? In the eMarketer report, <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/changes-to-facebook-advertising-after-cambridge-analytica"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Changes to Facebook Advertising After Cambridge Analytica</a>, researchers decided to find out and discovered four things smart marketers are doing now:

<ol>
 	<li><strong>Reducing reliance on third-party data</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Though Facebook directly handled third-party data and relationships, it won’t any longer, and now this responsibility will fall directly on marketers’ shoulders. For instance, marketers who used Facebook’s Partner Categories third-party data still can, but it’s going to be much harder. Since the data won’t be available through Facebook anymore, they will have to work out deals of their own with third-party data vendors.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Our paid social director Christy Clarke, one of the industry leaders featured in eMarketer’s report, said due to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/facebooks-third-party-data-changes/"">Facebook’s third-party data changes</a>, “we will have to pay third-party partners and create custom audiences for the same segments that today we’re getting for free. That’s a little frustrating.”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">More responsibility, more work and more expenses may be a little frustrating to marketers but even more so is having to vet and assume the risks that come with negotiating and managing their own third-party partners and data, especially since they haven’t had to before. Naturally, to avoid all these potential pitfalls, marketers want to use less third-party data, if they can.</p>
[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""true"" border_sizes_top=""0"" border_sizes_bottom=""0"" border_sizes_left=""0"" border_sizes_right=""0"" type=""1_1"" first=""true""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" class="""" id=""""]
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li> <strong>Expanding first-party data</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">One way to use less third-party data is to gather richer and more comprehensive <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-tips-to-protecting-your-customer-data/"">first-party data</a>, especially since it has many advantages. It’s cost-effective and less risky for marketers regarding privacy concerns, and owning it comes with peace of mind: You get to control it, keep more customer data and insights in-house and don’t have to worry about it suddenly becoming restricted or having less of it.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">At Goodway, growing our first-party data is a big focus. Christy told eMarketer we’re “getting smarter with our first-party data and prioritizing the segmentation of that data.” She also said we’re “using our first-party segments for <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/proven-strategies-for-better-performing-ads-from-a-real-facebook-ad-campaign/"">look-alike targeting for prospecting</a> so that we’re not relying heavily on third-party data.”</p>

 	<li><strong>Closely monitoring Facebook user activity</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">When the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke, marketers became nervous. They feared Facebook users would scale back their activity or delete their profiles altogether. And according to the latest eMarketer research, that fear is understandable:</p>
[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""true"" border_sizes_top=""0"" border_sizes_bottom=""0"" border_sizes_left=""0"" border_sizes_right=""0"" type=""1_1"" first=""true""][fusion_imageframe image_id=""4857085941"" max_width="""" style_type=""none"" stylecolor="""" hover_type=""none"" bordersize="""" bordercolor="""" borderradius="""" align=""none"" lightbox=""no"" gallery_id="""" lightbox_image="""" alt="""" link="""" linktarget=""_self"" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/eMarketer-Facebook-Blog-Bar-Chart.png[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""true"" border_sizes_top=""0"" border_sizes_bottom=""0"" border_sizes_left=""0"" border_sizes_right=""0"" type=""1_1"" first=""true""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" class="""" id=""""]
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">But Christy said she doesn’t see that happening now, “Users have maintained how they use the platform and how frequently they [access] it. What’s most important to us as marketers is the targeted reach conversation, and that those [capabilities] have not been impacted by any data misuse.”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Since usage and Facebook’s targeted reach capabilities don’t appear to be impacted for now and users are still actively seeking out brands and interacting with them on the platform, marketers’ spending levels will likely hold firm.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">But that doesn’t mean marketers aren’t keeping a careful eye on Facebook metrics. If they must re-evaluate their Facebook budget and consider scaling it back, they will.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Facebook changes, like the scandals, are particularly a concern to marketers because they can suddenly put their paid social media efforts in peril. Take this example: Facebook just made changes to its ad targeting program by giving users the ability to delete their browsing history and have more control over their privacy settings.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">If all users took advantage, it could negatively affect marketers and their ability to measure traffic to and from Facebook. But, in the report, Christy said she doesn’t think this particular change will have much impact, “The misuse of data is going to drive some users to lock down their privacy, but I think the majority will likely only clear their history once when the features roll out, if at all.”</p>

 	<li><strong>Diversifying paid social media strategy</strong></li>
</ol>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;"">Marketers are confident Facebook is still an efficient platform to connect and interact with their audiences, but they will be closely monitoring the second half of 2018 and preparing a fallback plan just in case, one that incorporates a mix of other social and non-social platforms. Though these platforms don’t offer the reach Facebook does, they are currently more well-regarded, so diversifying the plan and adding a mix of Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest, Instagram or Amazon could be beneficial.</p>

This is not news. Or at least, it shouldn’t be. Clicks have been dead for quite some time. <a href=""http://blog.pixalate.com/programmatic-digital-ad-fraud-benchmarks-report-mobile-video-desktop"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Many of the clicks are fraudulent</a>, and <a href=""http://adage.com/article/digital/incredible-click-rate/236233/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">studies have shown</a> that <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/162009/disconnect-nielsen-finds-no-relationship-between.html?edition=40075"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">clicks are not a reliable source of performance</a>. And yet, some advertisers persist in looking at CTR for digital advertising campaigns as a key performance metric. The realm of performance indicators has moved forward, and we can now track several other types of metrics to measure advertising success.

[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" dimension_margin="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" class="""" id=""""]

Before we look forward, let’s look back for a minute. Where did the intense focus on clicks come from? There are two main reasons clicks were a proxy for display advertising success. First, clicks were and still are the prominent metric for search ads, and this was carried over to display and all other digital channels. We now also have other ways of measuring the effectiveness of search ads, like phone calls, in-store visits and purchases among other KPIs, but given that we purchase search ads on a cost-per-click basis, clicks will always be important to search.

Secondly, while there are <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/why-your-marketing-reports-dont-match/"">several differences between web analytics and ad servers</a>, both initially focused on clicks as the main form of website or advertising engagement. These days, web analytics programs also use time on site and visual heat maps in addition to clicks to measure website engagement and are meant to track website activities. Ad servers now focus more on activities, particularly post-impression activities.

[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" dimension_margin="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" class="""" id=""""]

Website activities track from ad servers and can be used as KPIs on their own, but they also can be tied to purchases and in-store visits to calculate your true advertising campaign ROI. You can use this information to create a buy-through rate or visit rate and compare the number of total exposed customers to exposed customers who visited a store or purchased a product. It’s now possible to know the real impact your advertising has on your bottom line.

Regardless of the metrics you use to track success on your campaigns, you should always focus on using data from your ad server to measure your advertising campaigns, whether you serve your ads directly from a DSP, like AppNexus or The Trade Desk, or use an ad server like Google Campaign Manager (formerly DoubleClick Campaign Manager) or AdRoll. You should combine this data with website activity data from your web analytics programs to get a full picture of your customers’ engagement with your brand.

Not all goals are created equally. In many sports, the ultimate goal of the game is to win by earning points, whether that’s from hitting a home run, sinking a three-pointer or scoring a touchdown. However, we also track other stats during games like batting average, assists or tackles, which could be considered secondary goals. If players are doing well in their individual stats, they will be better able to help their team win the game.

In advertising, like sports, there’s an ultimate goal, which is usually a sale. If it’s a branding campaign, it might be increased awareness. However, there are other metrics we track, too, like increased site visits, eCPA, or increased foot traffic, to name a few. Depending on where in the funnel you are trying to reach customers, you might focus on a sales goal, or secondary or proxy goals. Let’s dive into which goals best match the different parts of the sales funnel.

Upper funnel goals usually focus on awareness since you’re attracting customers who might not be aware of your product or might be casually browsing. At this stage of the game, your goal could be increased website traffic or visits to your homepage. You might even want to consider creating your own Key Performance Indicator (eKPI), such as a ratio of visits to your homepage versus visits to a product page. Media channels to help drive awareness include <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"" rel=""noopener"">advanced TV</a> or <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/video-advertising-what-pros-know/"" rel=""noopener"">online video</a>. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/cross-device-targeting/"" rel=""noopener"">Cross-device display</a> can also factor into upper funnel goals, by using broader targeting tactics like site targeting or demographic targeting.

Lower funnel goals could be sales, or for items not purchased online, they could be activities or actions, which you can tie to an eCPA goal. Typically, you are reaching customers who already know who you are and have visited your website before, so you’re looking to get customers on repeat visits, or customers visiting pages that show a deeper level of interest, like a contact us page, or an hours and directions page. Or perhaps you have an online form for customers to fill out. Search is an excellent channel to reach lower funnel customers since they are actively seeking out information, but display tactics like site retargeting, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"" rel=""noopener"">look-alike targeting</a>, or <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/people-based-marketing-grow-crm-data/"" rel=""noopener"">CRM targeting</a> can also be a great way to drive activities.

Some advertisers choose to run multiple campaigns at a time, one to focus on the upper funnel and attract a new audience, and another to focus on that new audience and continue to push them through the funnel. Whichever part of the funnel you are focusing on, make sure that your goals and media tactics line up with what you’re trying to achieve.

Like any auction-based environment, CPM prices fluctuate minute to minute based on the competitive market, seasonality, time of day, and so many other factors. So how can digital advertisers ensure they are paying the best possible price for every impression they bid on?

It starts with setting up your ad campaigns to maximize programmatic’s ability to take advantage of auction mechanics. Programmatic is designed to spend your media dollars more efficiently, but only if you let it. Here’s how to ensure you don’t miss out:

<h4>Fixed CPMs vs. dCPMs</h4>
For years, fixed cost-per-thousand (CPM) pricing was the main buying model for advertising. Carried over from traditional media, fixed CPMs gave advertisers new to digital a way to estimate ad-serving costs and to guarantee a certain number of impressions – making the transition from traditional to digital media buying seem that much easier. This is because from a fixed number of impressions, you can plan for specific reach and TRP numbers, but this convenience comes at a cost. It’s simply not the most effective way to buy or measure digital media.

Consider this: Every auction-based platform from AdWords to DSPs works dynamically in real time; so why shouldn’t your buying model?

Dynamic CPMs (dCPMs) are native to digital advertising and give modern advertisers a better way to buy. With dCPMs, you still set a budget, but the price adjusts in real time depending on the website, placements, day, time, etc., so you can maximize your spend on <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/matching-your-advertising-goals-to-the-sales-funnel/"">the impressions that matter the most to your goal</a> – be it website visits, purchases, etc. And that’s just the beginning ...

<h4>Programmatic’s True Value</h4>
Too often, cheap inventory is fraud-ridden and won’t actually improve your business results. With a dCPM model, there is no advantage to serving to these kinds of low-quality impressions. Instead, dCPM focuses on hitting the key performance indicators (KPIs) that are most important to you by flexing the spend up or down based on the likelihood that the impression will give you the result you want, such as a conversion.

This flexibility also means as the campaign progresses, you can reinvest any cost savings back into the campaign to maximize the budget. For example, if you purchase the inventory at a lower price than expected, you will receive more impressions to fulfill the budget and vice versa.

Plus, dCPM pricing gives you a better view into where your partner’s true value lies – not simply in the delivery, but in the strategy behind the execution. How they adjust bids. How they ensure high-quality impressions. How they gather and analyze data to help inform your next campaign so you continue to improve month after month.

Taking advantage of auction mechanics to gain efficiencies and insights like these are the real benefit of running programmatically. And they can only be fully achieved on a dCPM model.

<h4>Shifting Models</h4>
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/whats-programmatic-worth/"">Programmatic pricing</a> has become a hot-button conversation in the ad tech industry. As IO-based business is decreasing with more and more digital advertisers embracing a flat-fee model, they are getting access to a dedicated team, a suite of premium data products, and valuable strategy and analytics that couldn’t have been cost-effectively included on a fixed CPM plan.

In many cases, these models also include performance-based bonuses for hitting certain benchmarks against campaign goals using dCPM strategies – the CPM is irrelevant when actual results are the focus. The idea is that this gives you the accountability you want from partners, and it enables programmatic experts to put more skin in the game.

But no matter the partner you choose, one thing is for sure, if you continue to cling onto fixed CPMs, then you’re going to miss out on the real benefits of programmatic. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/contact/"">Reach out to us</a> to find out more about how you can spend your media dollars more efficiently.

Understanding the impact of your online advertising is a challenge for all advertisers, but auto manufacturers seem to struggle here the most. Buying a car follows one of the longest sales cycles out there, and it’s an in-person purchase. Sure, certain aspects of auto buying are regularly conducted online, like model research on a manufacturer’s site or negotiating details via email, but the final step of signing an agreement and handing over the keys generally still happens at the dealership. So how can auto advertisers determine if their digital advertising helped to influence a sale? There are a few different options for offline attribution throughout the sales cycle.

<strong>Capture Dealership Foot Traffic</strong>

Measuring foot traffic applies offline attribution to the middle of the sales cycle and helps to gauge consideration among consumers. You can use beacon technology to capture customer device IDs as people enter the dealership, and then match those device IDs back to your advertising campaign. This solution will tell you if your advertising got people in the door, and it’s a great way to add real-world results to your upper-funnel metric tracking.

<strong>Utilize DMV Auto Purchase Data</strong>

Transactions are the next phase of the sales cycle you can measure with offline attribution. I know you must be thinking, <em>how can I track auto transactions, since cars are usually purchased through finance agreements</em>? Well, it’s a bit more complex than tracking foot traffic, but it is possible to connect household IDs to DMV state auto purchase data to impression data. Goodway Group’s <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/auto-purchase-attribution/"">Auto Purchase Attribution</a> solution uses household data from Oracle Data Cloud, DMV purchase data from Polk, and our campaign data to create a proprietary report that shows how many auto purchasers in a month saw your ads. Our buy-through rate compares users who saw your ads and bought a car to users who saw your ad but didn’t purchase, giving you a lift ratio.

<strong>Tap Into After-Market Credit Card Purchases</strong>

Finally, you can use credit card data to track after-market sales, like parts &amp; service purchases. While consumers don’t typically buy cars via credit card, they do often pay for parts &amp; service transactions via credit. You can use this data to create a lift study by separating your audience into control and exposed groups. The control group would be a suppression group that won’t see your ads, and the exposed group would be the audience you are advertising to. Then, you’d compare P&amp;S credit card purchase data for both groups to get a true lift on your advertising’s impact since you are comparing users who purchased after seeing an ad to consumers who would have made a purchase anyway.

In September, I visited London for <a href=""https://www.exchangewire.com/events/ats-london-2018/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ExchangeWire’s 2018 ATS conference</a>, an annual event for the online ad industry drawing in top-level executives from agencies, brands, publishers, and ad tech providers. With any event this large, the amount of information and discussion can be overwhelming.

That’s why after listening to debates on some of the biggest developments in ad tech, attending macro-focused workshops to reimagine the future of programmatic, and networking with peers as well as new connections, I’ve returned from ATS London with a few key pieces of advice for advertisers. If you didn’t go, this is what you missed; and if you did go, this is what you shouldn’t have missed.

<strong>STANDARDIZING DATA UNDER A UNIVERSAL ID</strong>

In today’s data-driven world, advertisers are overwhelmed with complexity. New channels to explore. New metrics to follow. A new generation coming of age. The excitement around the industry getting that much closer to marketing nirvana is overshadowed by frustration and confusion.

The primary pain for most advertisers centers on the inability to match individuals to devices across independent ecosystems. Without a universal user ID, brands are left to make sense of the data coming in from different platforms on their own.

A panel of C-suite leaders from Beeswax, PubMatic, Captify, and TripleLift agreed with and amplified this concern. In their view, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-the-gdpr-and-are-you-ready/"">GDPR</a> and <a href=""https://digiday.com/media/5-things-learned-ads-txt-2017/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">ads.txt</a> have brought independent providers together, but normalizing user data under a universal ID may prove to be a much bigger struggle. The reality is ad tech providers are going up against walled garden giants as well as their industry counterparts, so providers believe they need every advantage they can get to stay marketable. Being part of a shared universal ID goes against this dog-eat-dog mindset.

<em>My Advice for Advertisers: The old saying, “Money makes the world go round,” rings true here. The best way to put pressure on providers to band together behind a universal ID is to try to partner with those already working to make this happen. Know if your partners are part of the Advertising ID Consortium or involved in other initiatives to solve for a universal ID. And stay up to date on how their efforts translate to practical applications.</em>

<strong>TRANSITIONING TO A MORE TRANSPARENT MODEL</strong>

It should come as no surprise that one of the overarching messages throughout ATS London was the need for increased transparency. Advertisers want more pricing transparency, inventory transparency, value-chain participation, and so on.

At the conference, we saw an interesting panel discussion on in-housing, where key figures at Spark Foundry, Electronic Arts (EA), and Infinitive debated the hurdles and benefits of achieving complete transparency. While taking programmatic buying in-house might seem like an easy solution to get full transparency, unless you’re a powerhouse brand, it may not actually help control costs. Building out a team and tech to manage the entire process in-house can get expensive – surging well beyond the expense of working with a partner. For 90% of brands out there, reaching the tipping point where internal control saves long-term dollars isn’t realistic.

Instead, pushing for a more transparent model is what advertisers need to rally behind if they want to really maximize media value. You can’t wait for the industry to define the <a href=""https://adage.com/article/digitalnext/setting-straight-trust-better-transparency/306066/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">standards of trust</a>; you need to define them yourself and use them to guide who you choose to work with.

<em>My Advice for Advertisers: If you don’t know what you are paying for, then you shouldn’t be buying it. Advertisers need to dictate the rules of engagement up front and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/choosing-a-digital-ad-partner-5-questions/"">ask the right questions</a> to understand what they are paying for. Then, let ad tech providers explain the value and expertise they bring to the table. If what you’re getting from a provider is worth it, then you shouldn’t have a problem paying for it.</em>

<strong>APPLYING BLOCKCHAIN PROCESSES TO AD TECH</strong>

Aside from the usual suspects, there was one other topic that dominated conversations at ATS London: <a href=""https://digiday.com/marketing/blockchain-in-programmatic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blockchain</a>. We all crave simplicity. It’s why the Staples “Easy Button” campaign was such a success. But implementing blockchain in the ad tech ecosystem isn’t that simple.

At the show, Ken Brook of MetaX, Shailley Singh from IAB Tech Lab, and Charles Manning with Kochava led an interesting debate on “The Application of Blockchain in a Digital Media Environment.” But overall, I was pleased to have the reality of the blockchain situation laid to bare candidly by so many leaders at the conference – there is no doubt that 2019 will be an incredibly important year for blockchain’s development, but a marketable product for our industry is still two to three years away.

Everyone is eager to apply blockchain processes to the ad industry, but so many business practices need to get in line before blockchain has a chance of improving things for marketers. For example, all players in the supply chain have to agree to the same ledger (no easy sell) before blockchain can ever be a value creator in preventing fraud or ensuring transparency.

<em>My Advice for Advertisers: Don’t worry; you aren’t missing the boat on </em>blockchain<em>. Listen to leading voices from the industry and keep a pulse on how blockchain shapes up in 2019. And don’t get fooled into buying products promising practical blockchain applications – the tech isn’t there yet, so they’re either selling you an oversimplified solution or smoke and mirrors.</em>

Overall, the 2018 ATS London event lived up to its reputation. There were so many interesting sessions and insightful keynotes that I could go on and on.

Will 2019 be the year for programmatic audio? If you’ve been watching the headlines, it just might be. From <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/digital-audio-radio/in-buying-adswizz-pandora-becomes-a-programmatic-power-player/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pandora’s acquisition of AdsWizz</a> to <a href=""https://adage.com/article/digital/siriusxm-purchased-pandora-3-5-billion/315032/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SiriusXM’s play to buy Pandora</a>, recent signals have many in the industry believing that programmatic audio is finally reaching marketplace maturity.

We talked with Sarah Scherer, Media Product Manager at Goodway Group, about how these changes will impact Pandora advertising and the digital audio landscape.

<strong>Earlier this year, Pandora purchased the programmatic audio platform AdsWizz. What has this acquisition meant for Pandora advertising?</strong>

AdsWizz is a supply-side platform specializing in programmatic audio inventory, like iHeartRadio, podcasts and other audio sources. By purchasing AdsWizz, Pandora gained access to the pipes needed to sell their own audio inventory programmatically. Being full stack means Pandora doesn’t have to rely on third-party SSP tech anymore, like most other publishers.

<strong>What are the benefits of Pandora going programmatic for advertisers?</strong>

Of all the recent changes at Pandora, going programmatic brings the most significant benefits for advertisers:

1.      <strong>Enhanced targeting</strong>. The <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">targeting capabilities through a DSP</a> are typically much more robust than what’s available through a publisher direct buy. Now, Pandora’s advertisers have the ability to layer on sophisticated geotargeting, to seamlessly <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">integrate first-party data</a>, to access thousands of third-party audience segments, to apply enhanced optimization, and more to customize their campaigns.

2.      <strong>Expanded reach</strong>. Typically, each household only uses one audio platform, be it Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, or something else. It’s similar to selecting a cable provider. You choose one and then access the account across all of your devices. Advertisers who purchased audio exclusively through programmatic pipes in the past weren’t reaching the majority of Pandora households. Now, they can tap into Pandora households through the same programmatic platforms that they use to buy their other audio inventory.

3.      <strong>Holistic reporting</strong>. Previously, advertisers buying Pandora inventory had to get it direct from Pandora. This meant that after the campaign, advertises needed to pull any reports from Pandora and manually integrate them with other media reports to compare how each channel performed. Being able to buy Pandora advertising on programmatic pipes gives advertisers all their reporting in one place.

<strong>Compared to other ad formats, audio has been slow to catch on programmatically. What is holding audio back?</strong>

A variety of factors have held back programmatic audio, but none more than the creative assets required. Most brands have messaging and images they can pull together with limited effort for a display campaign. And some even have video that they can quickly edit for a 15- or 30-second online ad. But audio creatives are a totally different beast. Advertisers must tailor their audio ads to a channel where the audience almost always has eyes elsewhere. I don’t think that most advertisers have historically had high-quality audio assets readily available to activate campaigns.

However, I do think more money will flow into programmatic audio in the coming years as advertisers recognize the cost efficiencies and optimization benefits compared to linear radio. These benefits will drive the creation and execution of programmatic audio ads well beyond what we’ve seen in recent years.

<strong>Last month, Liberty Media, the parent company of SiriusXM, made moves to acquire Pandora. How does this impact the digital audio landscape?</strong>

The potential combination of SiriusXM with Pandora is game-changing. SiriusXM’s business model was built on leveraging automobiles to sell their subscription service. Joining with Pandora would allow SiriusXM to expand their footprint across devices, making their exclusive sports, radio and celebrity content available on phones, tablets, in-home assistants and more.

<strong>What does all this change mean for advertisers already in digital audio or those looking to get in?</strong>

There aren’t any immediate changes for advertisers already running digital audio. But remember that Pandora advertising still requires certain minimums, even if you run programmatically. While it is important to ensure you have a presence across all audio inventory that aligns with your target audience, make sure you can meet the requirements to run on Pandora inventory.

The holy grail for any advertiser is proof that your advertising resulted in sales. For e-commerce advertisers, such attribution is a fairly easy process. Tracking pixels monitor consumer behavior online and can tell you which of your customers saw your ads before purchasing, how many ads they saw, when they saw the ads, and so on. For advertisers in verticals where purchases largely occur offline, like QSR, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/three-innovative-marketing-solutions-to-measure-auto-purchase-attribution"">auto</a>, or CPG, online to offline attribution is more complicated. Here’s the key info you need to know to be an offline attribution pro.

<strong>Key Attribution Terms to Know</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Beacon</strong> – a small radio transmitter that connects to Bluetooth-enabled devices, like smartphones. It can be used to capture location data.</li>
 	<li><strong>Device ID</strong> – a unique, anonymous ID assigned to each smartphone.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hashing</strong> – a process to anonymize user data before using it in advertising so that no Personally Identifiable Information (PII) changes hands.</li>
 	<li><strong>Lift</strong> – a measurement that compares consumers who saw your ad and performed an action (like entering a store or making a purchase) to consumers who didn’t see your ad and did the same thing, showing you the impact of your ad on consumer behavior.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Types of Online to Offline Attribution</strong>

There are a few different types of online to offline attribution methods available.

<strong>Foot Traffic</strong> – this method measures how many people who saw your ads went into one of your stores or a store where your product is sold. Your attribution partner will capture mobile device IDs through beacon technology and match these IDs back to your campaign.

<strong>Point-of-Sale Data</strong> – the point-of-sale (POS) data attribution method measures credit card purchases made in one of your locations. The credit card company will usually partner with a data company to tie purchase information back to your campaign.

<strong>Panel Data</strong> – this method captures user location data through an opt-in panel. Users are asked about their locations through an app on their phone, and this data is tied to a unique ID, which is then matched back to your campaign.

<strong>Varied Data Source Matching</strong> – this method combines several types of data to create a proprietary attribution method. Goodway’s <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/auto-purchase-attribution/"">Auto Purchase Attribution</a> is an example of this attribution type, as it combines Polk DMV purchase data with Oracle household ID data and our campaign data together to create an attribution report.

<strong>Combining Online Metrics with Offline Attribution</strong>

Just because offline attribution is possible, it doesn’t mean you should entirely abandon online metrics like an eCPA. Tracking key online activities is still useful as a proxy for advertising success and will help your media team to make sure that they are reaching the correct audience. Additionally, most of these online to offline attribution solutions can’t be tied back to specific tactics or placements, so you can’t use that data for optimization. Your best bet is to combine both your online metrics with your offline attribution to continue to refine your advertising strategy and measure the impact on your bottom line.

Despite dire predictions, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-the-gdpr-and-are-you-ready/"">the arrival of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May</a> didn’t spell disaster for digital advertising. Reminiscent of Y2K, the news leading up to GDPR forecasted nothing short of an advertising apocalypse. Yet, May 25th and the months following came and went with few waves. This may be due to the fact that in the five months since taking effect, both GDPR compliance and enforcement have been slow to take off.

According to <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/20-of-companies-report-being-gdpr-compliant-post-may-25-deadline-300679827.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">recent research from TrustArc</a>, only 20% of U.S., U.K. and EU companies are fully GDPR-compliant, and just over 50% say they are still in the implementation phase. That leaves nearly 30% who have yet to even kick off their GDPR initiatives. Despite the slow start, almost 75% of companies believe they will achieve GDPR compliance by the end of the year.

And while thousands filed non-compliance complaints in the first month, the U.K.'s Information Commissioner's Office has not issued any fines yet. The lengthy review process and cross-border collaboration required for prosecution mean that true GDPR enforcement could be months away.

<strong>GDPR's Impact on Advertisers So Far</strong>

While the buildup to prepare for GDPR may have felt like an unnecessary fire drill for some, the impacts on programmatic are still being realized as more and more marketers establish the most effective ways to reach their target audiences in a <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/how-to-survive-in-a-first-price-gdpr-world/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">post-GDPR world</a>. Primary implications seen thus far are threefold:

1.      GDPR compliance put heavy limitations on advertisers that historically utilized third-party data targeting. This forced many to shift their targeting strategy to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">first- and second-party data</a>, where personalization and conversion are strong but scale is often limited.

2.      Contextual targeting received a resurgence as a result of GDPR. With a portion of consumers declining the capture and use of their personal data, retargeting efforts stalled for some brands. But contextual targeting filled the gap with the scalability and hyper-relevance marketers previously relied on from third-party data and retargeting efforts.

3.      Companies are preparing for similar data protection laws and regulations in the United States. Since GDPR’s launch, California passed the <a href=""https://digiday.com/media/wtf-california-consumer-privacy-act/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Consumer Privacy Act</a>, giving residents of the state significantly more control over their personal data. Although the law will not go into effect until 2020, it’s set the stage for other states across the country to follow suit.

It’s important to also note that the road to GDPR compliance has had positive impacts, too. The new regulation increases transparency and requires companies to review their data handling and processing procedures – which is just good business all around. And while GDPR is still in its infancy, there is good reason to celebrate and embrace the new level of cooperation it achieved among ad-tech stakeholders.

Every so often we get a call from a client asking why they aren’t seeing their search ads show up when they Google their brand’s main keywords. It’s only natural for an advertiser to want to check that their ad campaign is live and performing the way they hoped. But before you open that Google tab, know that searching for your own keywords is the last thing you want to do.

Not only can Googling for your ad give you an inaccurate picture of what’s going on, but it can actually hurt your SEM campaign in the long run. Let’s look at why this happens and review a few additional SEM strategies you need to protect your campaign’s success.

<strong>Don’t Google Your Own Keywords</strong>

Searching for your own ads can impact auction bidding thresholds and drive up your cost-per-click rate. And chances are, your ad won’t serve on your computer anyway because search results are custom for every user and keyword combination. Plus, if you keep searching for your ad and don’t click on it too many times in a row, search engine algorithms will assume it’s not relevant and potentially lower your Quality Score (QS).

Instead, our experts recommend using an <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/148778?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer%3Dfalse&amp;hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">ad preview tool</a>. Many search engines provide a tool to simulate the search results page that would appear for your targeted keywords, location, device type, and language.

<strong>Never Click On Your Own Ad</strong>

Don’t click on your own ad, even if it appears organically. You might be curious if your ad is redirecting to the correct location, but clicking on your own ad will cost you money that could be spent on converting another user.

A better SEM strategy is to simply make sure your website doesn’t have any broken pages or 404 errors. It’s also important to alert your advertising partners immediately if you experience issues or must change landing page URLs.

<strong>Expand Your Targeting for Better Results</strong>

Geotargeting a small area can limit the number of users who search for your keywords. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">Expand your targeting</a> to include a larger radius around a location or include zip codes or cities close by to tap into a larger pool of users who are already searching for you.

Also, remember search engines won’t show ads on every search if the keyword’s interest volume is low. So, make sure you aren’t targeting too specific, niche, or long-tail keywords that don’t drive high search volume. Our top SEM strategies also include adding in broader keywords or phrase match types to serve your ads in a wider range of searches and using consumer-friendly phrases rather than corporate jargon.

<strong>Analyze Your Budget and Schedule to Capture More Search Volume</strong>

Review the average cost per click of the keywords you’re working with, how often the keyword is searched, and external factors impacting the price, like seasonality or the competitive market, to make sure there are enough funds available to reach everyone searching. Then, decide how many clicks per day you want to achieve and adjust your budget accordingly based on your current average cost per click. This will ensure you don’t exhaust your SEM budget too early in the day.

Don’t forget to also research the hours and days when your audience is searching most to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-tips-heat-summer-ad-campaign/"">ensure your ad schedule matches typical user behaviors</a>. Finally, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/optimize-campaign-roi-without-touching-media/"">analyze your keywords, ads and landing pages</a> to ensure they all naturally relate to each other. Making the user experience seamless will help increase your ad relevance and QS so that your ads show more often in the daily search volume.

<strong>Don’t Overreact if Your Ad Isn’t Immediately Serving</strong>

The ad approval process for most search engines can take a couple business days, and you won’t see your ads serve until that process is complete. You can check the status of your ad approvals within the search engine’s ad platform, and if your ad is rejected, you can check their policies to quickly determine why your ad didn’t meet their requirements.

Ultimately, there are a variety of factors that can impact your search campaign.

In 2018, digital marketing trends dominated headlines inside and outside of the industry as <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/facebook-fallout-what-marketers-doing/"">Facebook faced the Cambridge Analytica scandal</a>, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-the-gdpr-and-are-you-ready/"">GDPR went live</a>, and <a href=""https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/06/26/why-att-bought-appnexus-and-the-deals-likely-outcomes#new_tab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AT&amp;T</a>, <a href=""https://adage.com/article/digital/siriusxm-purchased-pandora-3-5-billion/315032/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SiriusXM</a> and <a href=""https://martechtoday.com/adobe-confirms-it-is-acquiring-marketo-for-4-75-billion-224569"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adobe</a> all made major acquisitions. But as the year comes to a close, I’m already looking forward to seeing what new innovations and changes you can expect in 2019.

From this vantage point, there seems to be plenty to watch on the horizon. Some digital marketing trends expected to rise up are just more mature versions of their counterparts already in play and others are born of new game-changing technologies currently in development. So, take a break from your daily task list and take a look at the 2019 predictions you’ll want to know about before you build next year’s strategy:

<strong>1. This will be the year that advertisers get serious about audio</strong>.

The renaissance of digital audio – streaming radio, podcasts, voice assistants – has created one of the most anticipated opportunities of the coming year. And we’re not the only ones seeing that audio is primed for takeoff. From <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/digital-audio-radio/in-buying-adswizz-pandora-becomes-a-programmatic-power-player/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Pandora’s acquisition of AdsWizz</a> to SiriusXM’s play to buy Pandora, recent signals have many in the industry believing that programmatic audio is finally reaching marketplace maturity.

It’s no secret that mobile is driving digital media usage, with U.S. users devoting nearly 3.6 hours to a mobile device each day, according to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/mobile-soon-to-pass-tv-in-time-spent"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a>. But how are consumers spending that time on their devices? Listening. Audio takes up the biggest chunk of mobile usage at 52 minutes. But today, audio isn’t 100% synonymous with streaming music. People are sharing celebrity-curated playlists, downloading branded podcasts, and getting daily news briefs from their digital assistants. What this means is a variety of formats and niche audiences for advertisers to tap in 2019.

Compared to other ad formats, audio has been slow to catch on in the past, but rising adoption rates among voice-activated speakers and audio subscription services have marketers eager to apply it to next year’s strategy. Sarah Scherer, media product manager at Goodway Group, sums it up simply, “More money will flow into programmatic audio in the coming years as advertisers recognize the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/interview-recent-changes-mean-pandora-advertising"">cost efficiencies and optimization benefits</a> compared to linear radio.” With near limitless opportunities to target your audience and expand reach, there has never been a better time to take advantage of the power of audio.

<strong>2. Advertisers will simplify their media buying and reduce their risk of fraud by re-evaluating the number of SSPs they work with</strong>.

One thing came through loud and clear in 2018. Advertisers want to know exactly where their ads are running. This call for transparency isn’t just about the cost or impression numbers; it’s also closely linked to brand safety and the desire to avoid fraud.

Marketers focused on simplifying their media buying in 2018 started by <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/advertisers-cut-their-dsps-40-over-two-years"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">reducing the number of DSPs</a> they work with from 7.1 in 2016 to 3.9 this year, according to eMarketer. So, it’s not a big surprise that our 2019 predictions include the natural next step – limiting their SSP relationships too.

Our mission has always been to demystify digital marketing trends for our partners. So, let’s get clear right now on why the number of SSPs you work with matters. There are so many SSPs out there – too many actually. A lot of it is the same redundant technology, so you aren’t getting any extra value out of using 10 SSPs versus three. Instead, every SSP you add into your media mix adds on another layer of unnecessary complexity and increases your risk of encountering fraud or domain spoofing.

While expecting all those SSPs to agree and close up shop isn’t realistic, our president Jay Friedman suggests that marketers significantly reduce the number of SSPs with which they spend. He believes this will <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/many-ad-tech-companies-have-at-least-one-glass-wall/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">accelerate SSP consolidation</a> faster than any other force. If you consolidated your buying to a handful of SSPs, you could potentially leverage the aggregated buying volume to negotiate lower SSP take rates and trim ad tech fees from bid duplication. If nothing else, working with fewer SSPs means a lower risk for shenanigans, like bid caching.

At Goodway, we know more isn’t always better. That's why we’ve already scoured the SSP landscape and the open exchange to build a custom-curated programmatic exchange using only the SSPs that offer the cleanest, safest, highly viewable sites, apps and other digital inventory. I could geek out on our exclusive HSD marketplace all afternoon, but I’ll save those thoughts for another blog …

<strong>3. Many states will pass new data protection laws and regulations similar to GDPR</strong>.

Online marketing has been around for more than 25 years, and programmatic for more than 10. It’s simply time for everyone – advertisers, ad tech providers, and consumers – to unite behind higher standards. GDPR was the first step in that direction for the EU, and I expect U.S. regulations will quickly follow.

Already several states have introduced legislation to expand data privacy for their residents, giving them more control over how their personal data is collected and used. <a href=""https://digiday.com/media/wtf-california-consumer-privacy-act/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">California’s Consumer Privacy Act</a> goes a step further, requiring companies to make significant changes to their data handling and processing procedures. In Vermont, new legislation also requires data brokers to register with the state, better inform consumers about their options, and notify authorities of any security breaches.

While U.S. regulations will mirror many of GDPR’s protections, it is doubtful that states will deem data privacy a civil right, as it is in the EU. Instead, most states are looking to give consumers the right to demand that companies disclose what information they collect, to block that data from being sold, and to sue noncompliant companies. However, even if lawmakers in every state set the stage for these regulations, the laws and enforcement likely won’t go into effect for several years. For instance, Vermont’s changes for data brokers don’t kick off until 2019, and California’s Consumer Privacy Act doesn’t take effect until 2020.

In the meantime, if you’re looking for the most effective ways to <a href=""https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/how-to-survive-in-a-first-price-gdpr-world/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">reach your target audience in a post-GDPR world</a>, you may want to start by auditing your data management program. Review your data protection policies with your legal and compliance teams. Then, develop a real-time process for handling customer requests and opt outs.

As we enter another new year in just a few short weeks, I’d like to impart one more piece of advice: Remember that these changes aren’t silver bullets. Innovation can be exciting, but there are a number of hurdles to overcome first if we’re to truly see a digital transformation in the coming months.

Last November, we explained <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/header-bidding/"">how header bidding works and what advertisers should know</a>. Since header bidding adoption is on the rise, and advertisers and publishers are taking it to new levels of complexity and sophistication, we wanted to cover the latest developments. Jay Friedman, our president, recently contributed to this <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/header-bidding-update-2018"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2018 header bidding guide</a>, and here are five header bidding trends to watch in this quick update you need to read:

1)      <strong>Header Bidding Is Maturing on the Web</strong>.

With U.S. advertisers expected to spend more than four of every five digital display ad dollars this year via programmatic channels per eMarketer, web publishers are adopting header bidding to squeeze more money from programmatic advertising. In fact, according to ServerBid’s assessment of the top 1,000 websites that offer programmatic advertising within Alexa Internet’s Top 5,000 U.S. sites, more than half used header bidding as of May 2018:

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018-Header-Bidding-Trends-eMarketer-Chart.png""><img class=""alignnone size-full wp-image-4857086153"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/2018-Header-Bidding-Trends-eMarketer-Chart.png"" alt=""2018 header bidding eMarketer chart"" width=""1020"" height=""564"" /></a>

Since advertisers and publishers have a greater comfort level with header bidding, they’re each trying to refine this programmatic buying technique to make it more efficient, transparent and profitable for them.

Advertisers, wanting to weed out low-quality sources, boost campaign performance and save money, are doing this by focusing on supply-path optimization (SPO), evaluating supply-side providers (SSPs) and exchanges to find the most direct paths to publishers’ inventory.

Similarly, publishers are focusing on demand-side optimization (DPO), evaluating auction data and identifying the most active, beneficial programmatic partners and the best buyer and seller combinations to gain the most revenue.

2)      <strong>First-Price Auctions Are the Norm</strong>.

“Header bidding is still being adapted and adopted. But it is a fixture in the industry.” Jay Friedman, our president, recently told eMarketer. “<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-price-vs-second-price-auction"">Most auctions are going to first price now</a>, and it’s up to advertisers to bid algorithmically to ensure they’re paying the fairest price.”

Why the change to a first-price auction model? Second-price auctions are difficult to execute for header bidding, especially when multiple demand sources are involved. First-price auctions make more sense: Publishers get the highest amount possible for their inventory, and advertisers get more price transparency to see what impressions are truly sold for. That way, they can change or optimize their buying strategies to compete.

But <a href=""https://www.appnexus.com/blog/autopilot-bidding-first-price-auctions"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">discovering the right buying strategy</a> so advertisers don’t overpay for impressions in a first-price auction is a challenge. With inventory so vast and auction dynamics changing constantly, it’s nearly impossible to hit upon optimal bids manually. Advertisers need help, and that help comes from machines. That’s why, even though it’s expensive, many demand-side platforms (DSPs) are now reconfiguring to support first-price auctions and putting buying technology and tools in place to help advertisers bid to win.

3)      <strong>Three Header Bidding Containers Are Standard</strong>.

Header bidding has a range of benefits, like giving many advertisers at once a first look at an impression before the ad server and getting publishers top dollar for their programmatic inventory. But one major downside is it can cause increased page latency and page load times, which can then negatively impact the user experience.

To combat this, publishers use containers, aka wrappers, which is simply technology to help them maximize, organize and manage their many header-bidding partners and all the code and complexity that come with them. These containers help publishers ensure all bids are made simultaneously and the ad server receives accurate, understandable info so the best bid wins every time.

Our president, Jay Friedman told eMarketer: “The market seems to have settled on approximately three containers.”

These three containers are client-side wrappers, server-to-server wrappers, and hybrid wrappers. A good number of publishers don’t just use one or the other; they use both. Let’s look at each type:

·        <strong>Client-side wrappers</strong>: This type of wrapper is placed in the browser. Code is embedded on a publisher’s site and connects all buyers who want to bid on ad space. Client-side wrappers are transparent, and buyers are willing to bid higher for these opportunities because they get access to audience data (think cookies and meta info) they can use to best target their audience and maximize their ad campaigns. Still, page latency and slow page load times can still be a big issue if many demand sources are included.

·        <strong>Server-to-server wrappers</strong>: This type of wrapper appears on an external server and includes all the info that once went in the browser. Working from an external server, there’s no drain on page latency, or page load, or negative effect on the user experience. But, one downside is they are less transparent than their client-side counterparts. Buyers typically bid lower for these opportunities since they don’t have access to audience data and can’t be sure a specific user is a good match for their campaign.

·        <strong>Hybrid wrappers</strong>: This type of wrapper is popular because it’s a blend of both client-side and server-side wrappers. To increase the number of buyers without increasing the risk of page issues, publishers may choose to keep some buyers in a client-side wrapper and others in a server-to-server wrapper, depending on the buyers’ advertising goals. Those seeking cookies and visitor info to correctly target their audience may stay client-side, while those wanting to spread awareness or increase brand recall may go server-side. This lets publishers meet the needs of a great number of demand sources without losing money.

4)      <strong>New Money-Making Practices Are in Play</strong>.

Though questionable, here are a few header bidding practices you should be aware of and understand:

·        <strong>Bid caching</strong>: Publishers extend the life of bids. For instance, in this scenario, a buyer submits a bid but doesn’t win. The publisher then saves that bid for a small window of time, and if an impression comes up for sale in the header during that set time, the publisher submits the saved bid instead of rerunning an auction. This has ruffled the digital media industry because it’s not a transparent practice and sometimes is done without buyers’ knowledge. Won impressions from bid caching can hurt buyers’ ad campaign performance if they’re off-strategy or not brand safe.

·        <strong>Soft floors</strong>: This is an artificial bid that the publisher can insert in a first-price auction so advertisers submitting the highest bid must pay the artificial bid price, or, in a second-price auction, must pay more than the actual second-price bid. Soft floors can be frustrating because buyers can’t determine inventory ad value and implement a successful bid strategy. They don’t know if the bid that won came from the competition or artificially from the publisher.

·        <strong>Bid shading</strong>: Based on an ad tech provider’s calculation, buyers make a bid somewhere between the bids for a first- and second-price auction to not overpay for ad impressions. This practice is meant to get buyers more comfortable with the higher prices they now must pay due to the switch to a first-price auction model.

·        <strong>Net vs. gross bids</strong>: Sometimes, SSPs and exchanges submit a gross bid to a publisher to beat out other competitors who bid net. However, this is a deceiving practice. The gross bid may win, but the buyer ultimately won’t pay that price. They will pay the net price, which makes publishers lose out on expected revenue. To not be fooled, publishers are making more of a point to carefully check header-bidding contracts’ payment terms so buyers are locked in to only submitting net bids.

5)      <strong>In-App and Video Header Bidding Are Still in the Future</strong>.

Digital display and mobile web advertising are well on their way to adopting header bidding, but in-app and video advertising are behind and in the early stages with header bidding so difficult to implement there.

With in-app advertising, an app developer must add header bidder partners each time into an app’s software development kit (SDK), push out a new app version, and get users to accept and activate it, which is a multistep process that can be both time-consuming and challenging to accomplish.

As for video advertising, header bidding is done a little with out-stream video and native video but not for in-player video (pre-, mid-, and post-roll) yet. But there’s not much of a need to do it for in-player video anyway with inventory so scarce and publishers not struggling to sell it.

Over the past year, we’ve shared <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/advanced-tv-bother-guide/"">practical tips to improve your advanced TV buys</a>, answered your top <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/programmatic-video-explained/"">questions about programmatic video</a>, and shared industry resources to help you <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/connected-tv-advertising"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">stay ahead with connected TV</a>. But the questions we get the most from clients center around how they can prove their connected TV campaign had an impact beyond brand awareness, especially when it comes to driving actual foot traffic into their stores.

As the best of both worlds, connected TV delivers the impact and experience of traditional television with the measurement capabilities of digital video. Still, one of the biggest challenges for marketers is <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/matching-advertising-goals-sales-funnel/"">how to measure success</a>, particularly for advertisers who don’t have an ecommerce presence to track sales. How can they be sure their connected TV ads made an impact?

We recently worked with a national furniture retailer that posed this same question. Their previous connected TV campaigns yielded positive brand awareness results, but they wanted to prove their connected TV ads could drive meaningful business results (like increased store traffic), while remaining cost-effective (meaning a low cost per store visit).

Because this particular connected TV campaign was so successful – more than doubling in-store visits and lowering cost per store visit by 68% – I want to share the three steps we took to set up a foot traffic-focused campaign and some practical advice you can implement on <em>your</em> next connected TV campaign.

[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]

<strong>Step 1: Build Your Foundation With Only Quality Inventory</strong>

The foundation of any successful connected TV campaign (or really any digital campaign) is quality inventory. As the digital ad industry grows, more money is being funneled through it making it even more attractive for fraudsters. To protect your brand and your budget, you need to source the cleanest, safest highly viewable inventory. That’s the only way you’ll be sure that real people saw your ad.

Just like other types of digital media, not all connected TV inventory is created equal. But typically the more premium the content, the higher the completion rates and the lower the risk of fraud. So, for advertisers looking to deliver high-impact connected TV experiences that outperform standard benchmarks, we recommend premium private marketplace (PMP) deals and <a href=""https://adage.com/article/special-report-tv-upfront/glossary/309021/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">full-episode player</a> (FEP) ads.

PMP deals are fairly straightforward – they connect advertisers with preferred top-tier publishers, like ESPN, History Channel, and HGTV, that play on connected TV devices. So, if someone is watching the Food Network on their Roku, we can serve commercials across several Food Network shows just like they would see on regular TV.

FEP placements can be more difficult to uncover but are crucial to success. This is where a person streams 30- to 60-minute videos via a network’s app or website online, often with multiple ad breaks. For example, an FEP would include someone watching This is Us on the NBC app or on Hulu. Ads within FEPs are premier placements because they’re paired with long-form content, like a TV episode where viewers are likely to binge-watch. So advertisers can use FEPs to tap into a very captive audience.

We knew a media strategy that started with premium PMP deals and FEP ads as its foundation could help us surpass our furniture client’s expectations. But viewers can’t click on a TV ad, so we had to rely on other indicators to tie customer visits back to the ad campaign, which brings us to step 2.

[/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" class="""" id=""""][/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" padding_top="""" padding_right="""" padding_bottom="""" padding_left="""" margin_top="""" margin_bottom="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]

<strong>Step 2: Identify Customers Across All of Their Devices</strong>

It’s no surprise today’s consumers multitask across a wide array of devices and applications while watching television. The challenge for many marketers is matching individuals to all of those devices across independent ecosystems. For example, knowing that the user watching Hulu on their connected TV right now is the same person simultaneously browsing Pinterest on their tablet and is the same person that will log into their work laptop later tonight to check out the headlines on CNN.com.

Making sense of the data coming in from different platforms and devices is important to understanding what customers want and need. But most technology platforms treat a single user as different people when they switch between devices. This is where a cross-device identity graph comes in.

A cross-device identity graph typically comes from a third-party data company who owns a database of device IDs related to each other and to an individual user. Working with one of these data companies, like LiveRamp or Oracle, marketers can access data that identifies users who were exposed to their ads, no matter the device they are using. So when a person sees your ad on one device, like their smart TV, and then visits your brand’s site from their tablet, the identity graph makes the connection and tracks the touchpoints as a single customer.

Capturing this large user pool of cookies and device IDs is an important step in setting up a foot-traffic attribution study. Because while online shopping skyrockets for books, electronics and even groceries, furniture is one of the biggest purchases where people still want to try it before they buy it. So this step was critical to helping bridge the gap between online and offline measurement for our client.

<strong>Step 3: Set Up a Foot Traffic Attribution Study to Tie Visits Back to the Campaign</strong>

The holy grail for any advertiser is proof that your advertising resulted in a sale. For advertisers in verticals where purchases largely occur offline, like furniture stores, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/expert-guide-online-offline-attribution"">online to offline attribution</a> is more complicated.

This is where a foot traffic attribution study through a location intelligence platform, like Placed or Cuebiq, can make all the difference. These companies collect data from opt-in users to determine the real-world behaviors of smartphone consumers, like their location or proximity to a specific retailer. The goal is to measure how many people saw your ads and then went into one of your stores.

Here’s how it works: GPS captures device IDs as people enter your store. Then the platform matches those IDs back to the IDs of those who saw your ad through your cross-device identity graph. This gives you a clear answer on if your ads actually worked to bring in more foot traffic. By comparing your exposed visit rate to the unexposed visit rate (those who came into the store without seeing your ad), you can quickly calculate the lift from your ads. Plus, many platforms allow you to send panelists who visit your store a short survey to further evaluate product awareness and purchase intent between exposed and unexposed users.

You can also apply user attributes and behaviors tracked in a foot traffic attribution study to optimize your campaign. For instance, if a retailer sees that Hispanic audiences had a low delivery compared to other demographics but demonstrated a higher lift in visits, that meant this audience was more likely to visit the store but didn’t have to see as many ads as other groups to do so. With this in mind, you could increase bids on impressions to Hispanics for better cost efficiency.

However, it’s important to know that foot traffic attribution studies require a large volume of data to make these optimizations and comparisons. So you should work closely with your partner to ensure you have the scale necessary.

Knowing the advantages of using a foot traffic attribution study, we set up one to track users who saw our client’s connected TV furniture ads and then visited a store location. This opened the door to impactful insights that not only helped us optimize the campaign for better performance but also allowed our partner to prove their connected TV ads positively impact a person’s likelihood to visit their stores.

After running for nine weeks on premium connected TV inventory, the campaign doubled foot traffic into the furniture retailer’s stores. While the campaign delivered impressive performance results, our optimizations also ensured the campaign remained cost-efficient — saving on average $7.85 in cost per store visit. A win worth talking about!

A Nielsen cross-platform study found that in 2019, <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2019/03/18/50-fun-facts-about-march-madness/#677641f56ddb"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">over 175 million fans engaged with the tournament</a> across all networks and platforms.

Depending on the week, that coveted linear TV inventory is costing advertisers a whopping <a href=""https://adage.com/article/sports/cbs-turner-sell-out-march-madness-record-time/2237586"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">$825,000 to $2 million per 30-second spot</a>! In 2019, ad measurement firm <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/ncaa-championship-game-averages-19-6-million-viewers-tournament-tops-933-million-in-ad-revenue/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">iSpot.tv estimated that $933 million of ad revenue was generated</a> over the course of the tournament.

Linear TV is not the only way to reach the millions of fans who tune in to the games. And with many of the numerous games taking place during the workday, streaming allows fans to tune in using the device of their choice. In fact, fewer than a quarter (23%) of respondents ages 18+ cited TV as the way they would follow NCAA March Madness according to a  <a href=""https://today.yougov.com/topics/sports/articles-reports/2019/03/19/march-madness-bracket-betting-pools-2019"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">YouGov March Madness survey</a>. The next largest group (17%) stated they would follow news about the games through social media, TV, etc., 16% said they would check the scores online and another 8% said they would stream the games online.

Social platforms have evolved into entertainment hubs, with consumers now using them for purposeful activities around specific content they choose to consume. Referring to sports specifically, between 2016 and 2019, the percentage of people who said their main reason for using social media was to <a href=""https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-week/sport-social-media/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">watch or follow sports events grew 47%</a>. Additionally, Hitwise data shows that in the month of March, total visits to social networking sites for March Madness Enthusiasts is 341% higher than average.

Social networks aren’t the only sites experiencing increases in users and engagement during March Madness. As fans aim to catch the highlights or check the game scores they may have missed, advertisers have the ability to reach them in the moment with contextual and site targeting. Be sure to include smartphones and tablets in your strategies – users will be accessing content through multiple devices throughout the tournament so deploying a cross-platform strategy is a surefire way to be the MVP.

<h4>Do Your Research</h4>
Marketers should truly understand how their messaging will be received by black consumers before going to market with campaigns. Research and data are paramount.

Simply put, do your homework. Who's your customer base? What demographic factors are you targeting besides race? Will your campaign messaging interest and engage your customers and prospects? Alienate and repel them? Of course, you should know this well before you finalize your campaign. If you can’t see your creative from all angles internally, hire focus groups to gain new valuable opinions and perspectives. That way, you can see what you’re missing and catch any negative stereotypes or offensive content early on — most importantly, before your campaign launches into the world then nosedives into a massive mistake.

<h4><strong>Know Your Audience</strong></h4>
Be where your audience is, learn their likes and dislikes, find out what they truly want and need, and know what they expect from you.

To best engage with them, don’t talk at them; truly listen to them. Hear what they have to say and authentically engage with them. When you make building rapport and trust high priorities, you can further strengthen connections and encourage deeper, enduring relationships.

<h4>Respect and Empower Black Culture</h4>
According to a <a href=""https://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2018/black-impact-consumer-categories-where-african-americans-move-markets.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">2018 Nielsen study</a>, African Americans spend $1.2 trillion annually, which makes them a valuable trend-setting audience with considerable buying power. It’s vital you don’t miss the  mark when building a relationship with this audience. Ensure your creative, messaging and overall campaign has an authentic voice. That way, what you say can resonate and  make more of an impact.

Two brands I believe understand the power of black spending and influence of black culture are Nike and P&amp;G.

<a href=""https://www.adweek.com/creativity/nikes-new-colin-kaepernick-spot-inspires-you-to-pursue-your-craziest-dreams/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nike’s Colin Kaepernick campaign</a> communicated a message of support and alliance in an authentic way that audiences could connect with. There was also a larger universal message of bravery, overcoming obstacles and standing up for what you believe in.

And <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/parents-have-the-talk-in-powerful-my-black-is-beautiful-campaign-from-pg/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">P&amp;G’s My Black is Beautiful campaign</a> aimed to inspire 1 million black girls to believe in their beauty, which later led to their Imagine a Future program, creating opportunities for young black girls across the country.

Creating these types of successful meaningful advertising campaigns that truly support social causes, connect with black audiences and make a difference takes a lot of time, effort and care. But, more advertisers can do it – can tell authentic brand stories black audiences can get behind – if only they’re willing to do the research, know their audience, respect and empower black culture, and above all, do one big thing: Have ample black representation at the decision-making level.

<h4>There are lots of ad-tech companies to work for, so why Goodway Group?</h4>
I was attracted to how much importance we as a company put on the quality of the media and audience we buy for clients. We've always come at it from the perspective of, ""If this were <em>my</em> money, would I be okay with how we are using it? Would I be happy showing up on this site or buying that audience?"" That's how I know if I ever left Goodway to work on the brand side of the business, I would absolutely be thrilled to partner with the Goodway team.

<h4>How has Goodway Group helped you grow?</h4>
Goodway has realized that with the pace of change in our industry, we must evolve to compete. My job today is different from what it was a year ago -- and 10 years ago when I bought ad networks with a CTR goal -- and I have every expectation that it will continue to to be fluid in the years to come. That makes for a constant challenge; so my day is never dull, and I'm always learning something new.

<h4>How does this remote work thing really work?</h4>
My work wardrobe is probably what most people sleep in, and I consider putting on jeans to be ""dressing up."" Other than that, it works like any other job and really needs to be treated as such. You have to bring a certain level of discipline in order to focus but also the desire and ability to seek out actual people when you need to remind yourself that dogs are not actual co-workers. At Goodway, we try to build relationships with our co-workers through video calls. And it really does help being able to still see your co-workers. But, of course, I do miss being able to go grab a coffee with a work friend sometimes.

<h4>If we stopped by your house next Saturday, what would we find you doing?</h4>
On the weekends, I like to leave the chores (and my office) behind and get out of the house to experience good food and drinks, with even better friends and family. I love any kind of outdoor adventure that inspires me to live in the moment and create a lasting memory.

</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">In a statement, the newest FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said “restoring enforceable rules and reinstating the FCC as the cop on the beat responsible for protecting consumers” will protect net neutrality.

<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">If net neutrality rules are restored, they would prevent broadband providers from blocking or throttling internet traffic, charging fees for better delivery, or trying to keep content providers from reaching consumers.</p>

</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Jasmine Enberg, an eMarketer senior analyst, said, “Increased competition from new and existing social platforms is partly to blame for Snapchat’s decline. But the product launches the company announced last week, including an in-app gaming platform, may improve user engagement and time spent, particularly among its core young user base. Gaming also provides a new revenue stream for Snapchat that could boost its ad business in the future.”</p>

<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">According to Google, <a href=""https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/02/health-info-knowledge-graph.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><span class=""s2"">one in 20 search results are healthcare-related</span></a>. While many people are actively searching for healthcare advice online, determining how you should advertise your healthcare services, treatments and solutions to prospective patients can be tricky to navigate: You must carefully follow patient privacy rules and medical sensitivity best practices.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Since 2013, we’ve partnered with a leading hospital group to run over 300 digital advertising initiatives for all their healthcare specialties, ranging from maternity to oncology to bariatrics and more. This medical marketing experience has given us insight into what works and what doesn’t work when it comes to executing healthcare digital media campaigns successfully. If you’re looking for new ways to improve your own medical marketing – how to engage your own audience, drive more site traffic and gather more patient leads – here are our top three healthcare digital strategies to try when setting up your next digital campaign:</span></p>

<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Take Patient Privacy Seriously</span><span class=""s2""><b>
</b></span></h3>
<h4 class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Get HIPAA-certified</span></h4>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s3""><a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/training/index.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">HIPAA</a></span><span class=""s1""> stands for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which was enacted in 1996 and strictly governs how patient records are handled and shared in the United States. Having this certification gives those who work with you the confidence and peace of mind that you fully understand current HIPAA privacy laws and how to keep patients’ personally identifiable information (PII) safe.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">At Goodway, we are all currently HIPAA-certified and are recertified every two years. This ensures we have a firm understanding of patient privacy and can diligently follow all regulations. We keep patient data secure and anonymous because we use a secure hashing process to anonymize hospital customer relationship management (CRM) data before targeting it, then delete that data when a campaign is over.</span></p>

<h4 class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Advertise to Prospects While They Search</span></h4>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">To not intrude on prospects’ privacy, never retarget prospects from medical webpages. You never want to appear insensitive by reminding patients of their medical condition or make them feel tracked.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">To be most respectful of their privacy, let prospects conduct their own search for medical information; then, have your advertising appear at the top of search results so they can discover on their own what you have to offer.</span></p>

<h4 class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Produce Patient-Centric Ad Creative</span></h4>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s4"">When it comes to your healthcare digital advertising creative, make your messaging patient-focused. Keep it upbeat and positive and focused on healthcare services and solutions. This isn’t the place to get heavy or to mention illnesses or treatments.</span></p>
[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_image_id="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_size=""0"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" box_shadow=""no"" box_shadow_blur=""0"" box_shadow_spread=""0"" box_shadow_color="""" box_shadow_style="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""no""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]
<h3 class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Determine the Right Targeting to Find Your Audience</span><span class=""s2""><b>
</b></span></h3>
<h4 class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Take Advantage of First- and Third-Party Data</span></h4>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Use your first-party data, the customer relationship management (CRM) data you have already gathered and own. Marketing to your own prospects who are already open to and interested in what you have to say is valuable and could just be the key to generating more patient leads.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">But, what if you don’t have enough first-party data for your campaign? If you need more data to work with, you can supplement it with third-party data. Third-party lifestyle data segments can offer similar prospects to your existing patients who are just as receptive to your message.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Or, take another approach: Go after those third-party segments beyond patients that include caregivers, those who help patients day to day and who are likely to have a say in their medical decisions.</span></p>

<h4 class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">Make Site, Search and Cross-Device Targeting Work for You</span></h4>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Once you’ve made the most of first- and third-party data, try these targeting types:</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Use site targeting to find those sites that over-index for your audience so you can get in front of the right people at the right time with your message.</span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Since you can’t target by a specific ailment when running a medical digital marketing campaign, use category and keyword contextual targeting to reach prospective patients effectively with your ads at the precise moment they are reviewing relevant content online. Don’t forget to conduct daily keyword-level performance reviews and adjust the keywords as needed across all the channels of your healthcare campaign so all channels can benefit from your keyword optimizations.</span></p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s3"">Or, try cross-device targeting and reach patients on all their devices to reinforce your message, no matter what digital device they may be on – their desktop, laptop, tablet or phone.</span></p>

Bringing programmatic in-house is an increasingly popular move for marketers looking to gain more control and transparency in their media campaigns. But, the question of whether or not to ultimately take programmatic in-house doesn’t have to be a binary choice.

While some brands may succeed in bringing 100% of their programmatic in-house, others may fair better closer to the middle of the spectrum, by defining the media spend and objectives in-house but outsourcing day-to-day execution and specialized expertise to an agency or digital partner. The range of in-housing options is limitless, but three typical points on the in-housing spectrum include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>100% Collaboration</strong> – Brand, programmatic agency and ad tech partners work together on all aspects of media planning, buying and analysis</li>
 	<li><strong>Shared Success</strong> – Some needs remain in-house (such as setting the media budget and identifying success metrics), but others are outsourced to an agency as needed (such as media planning and buying, measurement and reporting, and specialized skills and expert consulting) to ensure everyone is invested in a shared win</li>
 	<li><strong>100% In-House</strong> – All programmatic tech, planning, buying and analysis is done by in-house teams</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions to Consider</h3>
Marketers may want to take all or some services in-house for many reasons. But, before deciding if bringing programmatic in-house is the right solution for your organization, answer these important questions and gain some perspective around if in-housing aligns with your long-term marketing goals.
<h4>What marketing services are you looking to bring in-house?</h4>
In-housing means different things to different people. In a recent report from the Association of National Advertisers (ANA), nearly eight out of ten marketers use an in-house agency. Yet, fewer than one quarter said they in-housed programmatic services, proving the importance of defining what type of in-housing you’re really considering – and also proving the importance of working with an expert or specialized partner in the programmatic space.
<h4>What’s your plan to source and retain programmatic talent?</h4>
People with programmatic skills are scarce in most markets, but if you do convince them to come aboard, make sure to create a clear <a href=""https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/learning-development/why-2019-is-the-year-of-learning-and-development-insights-from-linkedins-2019-workplace-learning-report/#new_tab"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">career path for continual growth and development</a>. Agencies can hire brilliant people and continually give those people new opportunities to learn and grow across different verticals. So, finding the right people with the right skills who will stick with your company for the long term may be a challenge.
<h4>What have you done to level up your team’s skills?</h4>
If you already have people on your team who do some online marketing, don’t assume they can also do programmatic well. Programmatic trading requires different competencies and training from other marketing roles. Simple setup mistakes, like forgetting to set your budget cap, can be crippling to an advertising budget and a drain on your team’s morale. Having an expert in-house is nice, but your programmatic team needs to be far more robust than the trading arm in order to manage relationships with ad tech companies, negotiate contracts, analyze data, monitor and test emerging tech, and develop advanced algorithms for the long term.
<h4>How will you keep up with industry trends, technologies and tactics?</h4>
The research tools, resources and volume of advertising necessary to keep up to date on the latest trends and products require big budget and time investments. Competition is fierce in digital marketing and <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/how-technology-is-changing-ad-agency-structures"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">staying innovative month after month</a> is key. Without the daily cross-advertiser insights and cross-industry analytics coming in from an agency or market research intelligence, your campaigns and your team’s skills will stagnate and your competitors may leave you in the dust.
<h4>Programmatic requires advanced data science and tech, so how will you integrate those?</h4>
Performance-enhancing algorithms, like supply-path optimization, are a must to mitigate challenges with fraud, frequency capping and attribution. Programmatic is complex, and not all inventory is created equal. DSPs have basic settings available, but <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/ai-marketing-revolutionize-ad-campaigns/"">going beyond a DSP’s baseline algorithm with artificial intelligence</a> is the new standard to unlock high-quality inventory, avoid fraud-ridden sites and access powerful insights to make your campaigns more effective. Just as important is to make sure your tech systems integrate with each other and existing infrastructure. If you have siloed platforms, data and measurement, your strategy will be inconsistent and lead to major operational headaches.
<h4>Do you have alignment at the C-level?</h4>
Ramping up an entire department isn’t cheap, but it takes a team of people and resources to do programmatic right. As soon as you start scaling your head count, you’re going to raise red flags and look like a cost-reduction center to your CFO. Every leader in the organization needs to understand and buy into your vision. Without enterprise-level alignment, your invaluable data scientists, researchers and analysts might be co-opted by other departments, which could jeopardize the success of your advertising efforts.
<h4>Do you have the budget to justify in-housing?</h4>
Analysts recommend that marketers should plan to spend at least $20 million per year on digital advertising before they consider bringing programmatic in-house. Strong buying power is required to compete in the programmatic marketplace successfully. Plus, the costs for technology, data and talent need to outweigh the spend to bring programmatic services in-house. Basic media planning, data management and reporting tools will run you over $250K each year. Then, you’ll also have DSP fees and staff salaries to pay out before you even spend one dollar on working media.

<h3>Brands Doing In-Housing Right</h3>
Netflix, EA Games and Wayfair have all seen success bringing programmatic in-house. What do all three of these companies have in common?
<ul>
 	<li>They are brands that lean in on technology, and technology is at the core of their business</li>
 	<li>They execute and maintain a strategic, comprehensive data strategy</li>
 	<li>They have significant budgets that justify the time, effort and costs to take programmatic in-house effectively</li>
</ul>
If you fancy yourself like one of these companies, ask yourself: Are you good at hiring data scientists because you will need a minimum of two or three solely focused on media to do this right. Are you also committed to hiring multiple engineers to build and maintain your ad stack? These are important questions, but the most important to ask is this: Do these investments help you to deliver on your brand promise to consumers? If you answer yes to these, in-housing may make sense for your brand. But remember, even these brands struggle at times from siloed thinking and a lack of the cross-industry insights and expertise agencies deliver.

<h3>Multi-location Digital Marketing Experience</h3>
Anyone can say they can handle your digital marketing, but few have the experience and expertise to streamline and support complex multi-location campaigns seamlessly, to handle all the moving parts.

Ask potential partners what verticals and clients they have worked with in the past. Find out if they have relevant experience in your field. Learn about their big wins, their biggest challenges and opportunities. Know their track record.

Ensure they have custom turnkey systems so your digital marketing campaigns can go off without a hitch. Are the systems scalable, meaning can they still run your campaigns smoothly when they must ramp up and handle more locations? Here are a few helpful turnkey programs your franchise digital marketing consultant should have in place:

<strong>Multi-location Digital Media Program Enrollment</strong>: How do they handle digital marketing program enrollment? Is it through a web portal? If so, is the web portal well-designed, a breeze to navigate, and easy and quick to use? (Enrollment should take less than 10 minutes.)

<strong>Multi-location Digital Advertising Creative and Offers</strong>: What’s the process to view and approve advertising programs, creative and offers? How quickly can they get digital advertising live? Make changes? Switch out limited-time offers or gear certain offers to specific markets?

<strong>Multi-location Digital Media Campaign Performance Reporting</strong>: Can they provide daily performance reports that are easy on the eyes and easy to understand? Can you get more analytics if you need them? Getting this campaign data will not only help you understand how your campaign is faring but give you insight into how to improve. Your chosen consultant can then use these findings to optimize your campaign in real time.

<strong>Multi-location Digital Media Campaign Billing</strong>: Billing is never fun. But, when many locations or individual business owners are involved, it can get downright complicated and confusing fast. Is your potential provider happy to wade through billing, compliance and corporate advertising reimbursements and handle it for you, for all your locations? How involved do you have to be? Is it a straightforward, simple process and headache-free?

<h3>Hyperlocal Marketing Knowledge</h3>
Consumers like to connect with local businesses through search engines. A <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/advertising-channels/search/how-advertisers-can-extend-their-relevance-with-search-download/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google report</a> mentioned 50% of consumers who performed a local search on their mobile phone visited a store within a day. And, according to <a href=""https://seoexpertbrad.com/local-seo-stats/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">HubSpot</a>, 72% of consumers who search for local businesses end up visiting stores within five miles. Does your potential franchise digital marketing consultant have the knowledge to help you hone your local marketing efforts to drive quality local leads to your door? Can they help you turn these leads into customers?

Find out if your prospective digital partners can build microsites to promote different locations and individual advertising offers and promotions. Can they map your locations on all the major platforms and add current and consistent contact info to local business directory listings across the internet? This is so time-consuming to manage and keep up to date but is important so consumers can quickly find or contact you.

Responding to customer inquiries and reviews in a timely manner can be tough to make time for in the day-to-day whirlwind of all you have to do. Can your potential partner help you monitor and respond quickly to your customers’ questions and their reviews?

Can your potential franchise digital consultant advise and handle your paid search advertising and social media efforts?

All these local marketing efforts can drive more qualified traffic to your locations.

<h3>Research- and Data-Driven</h3>
To grow your multi-location brand or business, capture leads, sell more to current customers, and pitch your prospects, you need excellent insights. Research and data can help you learn how to best speak to and reach your customers and prospects and tell you if your media strategy is effective and on target.

Qualified franchise digital marketing consultants should be able to tell you where your customers and prospects go online and how they get there. They should be able to conduct audience targeting across devices using a variety of channels. Most of all, they should be transparent with you about your performance metrics and audience data (your target segments, channels, and tactics) and how they’re affecting you financially. Whatever your customers or prospects are doing, research and data can help you identify leads and reach them.

<h3>Media Savvy</h3>
Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland, Dallas, Miami, Tulsa. No market is the same, so taking a one-size-fits-all approach to the media plan doesn’t work with multi-location campaigns. Can your prospective franchise digital marketing consultant adapt and personalize digital marketing at the local level? No matter the market size, big or small, you need someone familiar with the entire country and with extensive regional and local knowledge to build a successful media plan specific to each market.

Find out how well your potential digital consultants understand various markets and their opportunities. Do they know the markets’ circumstances, events, teams, landmarks, and such? Find out how well they understand the target audience for each – their characteristics, demographics, likes and dislikes, their income, education, challenges, needs, and desires.

The franchise digital marketing consultant you choose must be nimble and flexible enough to take your overarching national plan and customize it, test it and optimize it for any area, using the best technology, the best channels and tactics to fit your unique needs.

<h3>Easy to Work With</h3>
Different clients and verticals can be challenging. How can you manage everything when marketing is only one of many things you need to do each day?

Find a digital media partner that has extensive know-how, that cares about all the little details as much as you do, and that can answer all your questions and dive right in to help you. Look for one that truly cares about your unique challenges and can quickly give you the research, answers and solutions to help you succeed.

Can your potential franchise digital media provider quickly learn about and support your brand standards across the country while supporting business owners’ local efforts as well? Building your national brand – your identity – helps customers and prospects learn about and become interested in you. Uniformity and consistency are key. Local markets should share and build on the national message so no matter where a consumer goes, all locations have a similar look and feel and extend the same customer experience.

Is your prospective consultant transparent and willing to share their knowledge? Are they willing to take the time to teach you so you can understand the benefits of digital marketing for your brand or business and how your investment will drive growth and traffic now and in the years ahead?

Your potential digital media provider should be approachable and accessible. Can they take your phone call and pop in regularly to meet with you in person? Can they help you sort out your day-to-day concerns and get involved with establishing and building your presence in local communities? Can they get you plugged in with prospects and customers so you can grow these relationships and build trust?

When you’re scoping out franchise digital marketers and trying to select the best candidate for the job, it can be overwhelming and nerve-wracking. It’s too big of a decision to choose wrong. So, follow my must-have list to ensure you ask the right questions to make a well-informed decision:

A franchise digital marketing consultant may be expected to coordinate and support up to hundreds (even thousands) of business owners’ needs, demands and individual programs around the country and around the clock at the same time. If that weren’t pressure enough, they must also provide the right strategies to successfully engage many different audiences in various markets at once to turn leads into sales. These tasks are incredibly hard to pull off, let alone do well. That’s why the one you pick must be well-rounded – must be media-savvy and research- and data-driven, must be easy to work with, and have the multi-location experience and hyperlocal marketing knowledge you need to succeed.

When you discover one with all the qualities you’re after, one that seems to check all the boxes, you’ll know you’ve found the right fit, the right franchise digital marketing consultant for you.

 	<li>Roku, one of the most popular over-the-top (OTT) platforms, is <a href=""https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/336148/roku-launches-activation-insights-ott-ad-product.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">launching Activation Insights</a>, a new tool in its Ad Insights Suite that will analyze a marketer’s linear TV campaign performance and the streaming video audience the campaign may have missed and then suggest where to spend the budget on Roku’s platform to close that gap.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Streaming video gives you control to watch your favorite TV and movies on-demand anywhere and anytime from any Internet-connected device.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Scott Rosenberg, senior vice president-GM of Roku’s platform business said, “By adding the ability to tie advertising performance on linear with a specific audience that advertisers can gain on OTT, we are addressing a longstanding industry challenge for <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-steps-capturing-retail-traffic-connected-tv"">OTT media planning</a>. We believe it’s no longer a question of when advertising budgets will shift to streaming but how much.”</p>

 	<li><a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-bets-kohl-own-brick-090001688.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Due to Amazon’s partnership with Kohl’s</a>, customers will now be able to return Amazon merchandise at 1,150 Kohl’s locations by this summer.  This is a win for all involved: Amazon gets a more affordable way to handle returns while building its physical presence and combating competitors, Kohl’s gets more foot traffic through its doors, and consumers get an easier Amazon return process.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Another element of the partnership will let Kohl’s sell Amazon electronic devices at 200 store locations as of this summer. If all goes well, Amazon could offer private-label groceries and apparel at Kohl’s in the future.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, said, “Amazon is approaching $300 billion in annual sales, and it knows it can only grow so much online. A big brick-and-mortar acquisition is inevitable. If you’re an odds maker, you’d say the probability of [it being] Kohl’s has increased.”</p>

</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Viewers will be able to use their iPhone or some Android phones to buy clothes or products shown on TV shows or commercials, and the programmer will get a portion of the sale.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Here’s how it will work: Viewers will aim their phone’s camera at a shoppable link on the screen, which will scan a QR code. Then, when they tap a button, this code will link viewers to an ecommerce site where they can make their purchases.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">We will own every point in the purchase funnel,” Josh Feldman, EVP, head of marketing and ad creative at NBCUniversal said. “We’ve had a ton of research showing TV has a huge impact on the bottom of the funnel. This will allow us to prove that out in real time.”</p>

 	<li><a href=""https://digiday.com/media/new-york-times-bets-ad-pendulum-swinging-back-context/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The New York Times is developing a less-invasive ad strategy</a> to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-tips-to-protecting-your-customer-data/"">protect its subscribers’ personal information</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">During the 2019 NewsFronts, the publication said its new advertising targeting will give marketers new capabilities to reach their readers contextually, based on their motivations (launching in Q4 this year) or based on article topics they’re viewing (launching next quarter).</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">“It would have been really weird if, one year ago, two years ago, we’d gone the way the rest of the industry and said, ‘We’re sharing our subscribers’ personal information. We know everything about our subscribers, and we’ll let you pinpoint them as a marketer,’” the Times’ global head of advertising and marketing solutions, Sebastian Tomich, said. “We’ve gone in the opposite direction. And that feels right.”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""> “This is a bet for us,” he went on to say. “I think there is an argument, and it’s early to make the fully formed argument, that the industry has course-corrected so far into precision audience targeting that there’s actually diminishing returns, and you can get more, at least for now, if you try a bit of focus on context.”</p>

At their <a href=""https://events.google.com/io/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">annual I/O developer conference</a> in May, Google announced two new initiatives for its Chrome browser set to launch later this year. Google’s privacy controls and new cookie requirements previewed at the event are expected to increase user control over their data and prevent fingerprinting without user consent. This is great for <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-tips-to-protecting-your-customer-data/"">consumer privacy</a>, but how will these upcoming changes impact your advertising campaigns?

<h3>What’s Changed?</h3>
The first initiative tackles cookies and will require website owners to specify which kind of cookie they want to install on a user’s Chrome browser – a first-party single domain cookie (the kind that preserves user logins and settings) or a third-party cookie (which enables websites and advertisers to collect data on user preferences). To be clear, third-party cookies are not going away or getting banned by Google. Websites just have to identify the cookie category moving forward.

However, unlike <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/intelligent-tracking-prevention"">Safari’s recent ITP efforts</a>, Google’s privacy controls are putting users at the helm, including giving users the ability to turn off or delete different types of cookies. In a <a href=""https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/improving-privacy-and-security-on-web.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">blog post</a> from Ben Galbraith, director of Chrome product management, and Justin Schuh, director of Chrome engineering, they explain, “This change will enable users to clear all [cross-site] cookies while leaving single domain cookies unaffected, preserving user logins and settings. It will also enable browsers to provide clear information about which sites are setting these cookies so users can make informed choices about how their data is used.”

The second initiative addresses fingerprinting, which is a way for websites to collect information about users’ browsers, plugins, devices, and more. Because fingerprinting doesn’t use cookies, websites can access a user’s browser fingerprint without a user’s consent. As part of the preview, Google shared plans to more aggressively restrict these kinds of tracking technologies. While these announcements were made in May with the expectation of rolling out changes by the end of 2019, details surrounding the implementation for Google’s privacy controls have not been made public yet.

<h3>What Does This Mean for Advertisers?</h3>
While Chrome represents over two-thirds of desktop browser market share and 63% of mobile browser market share globally according to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a>, it’s difficult to precisely say how much Google’s changes will impact advertisers until we see how Google plans to promote the new features to consumers. If the capability to turn off cross-site cookies is user-friendly and prominently displayed, it may prompt some consumers to act. However, if the functions are hidden or buried in a settings menu like Chrome’s current functionality to erase all cookies from a user account, then the impact to advertisers will be minimal.

Certain ad-supported businesses, like online publications who rely on cookies to learn information about their readers and sell advertising space, may have a hard time adjusting to Google’s privacy controls at first. This puts the onus on businesses to rely more heavily on first-party data and to ensure their compliance with privacy regulations to maintain those strong data sets.

<h3>How Is Goodway Responding?</h3>
No changes have gone into effect yet, and while this may result in the deletion of some data-tracking cookies, we aren’t expecting a significant impact at Goodway Group. However, our team is working closely with demand, supply and data partners to monitor this news and set up our clients and their campaigns for success throughout 2019. As any digital media buyer will tell you, data on the websites people visit and how they behave on different sites is critical to building a long-term successful campaign. Fortunately, we’re one step ahead to ensure your campaigns stay on track.

Moreover, we support steps that the digital ecosystem takes to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/current-state-GDPR-compliance"">increase consumer consent and control</a>, knowing these improve the overall online experience and trust between publishers, advertisers and consumers. The industry has been moving away from third-party cookies for some time now, but it takes time to develop a more efficient, privacy-friendly model. Besides Google’s new privacy controls, several other efforts are already underway to move the industry in the right direction, including <a href=""https://www.thetradedesk.com/industry-initiatives/unified-id-solution"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Trade Desk’s unified ID solution</a>, <a href=""https://www.adidentity.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Advertising ID Consortium</a> and the <a href=""https://www.digitru.st/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">IAB’s DigiTrust ID</a>.

Hospitals face a unique challenge in digital advertising since they need to reach patients who need medical services but must do so in a way that doesn’t feel invasive. As a marketing and advertising partner to healthcare clients across the U.S. for over 90 years, we know how to promote patient-centric and privacy-compliant messages while still helping our clients reach new patients. Since 2013, we’ve successfully partnered with a leading hospital group in New Jersey on over 300 digital healthcare marketing initiatives, helping them promote a variety of their medical group practice areas while also enabling patients to get access to new services and the latest treatments in their area.

To take advantage of all we have learned in the process and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-medical-marketing-digital-strategies"">to emulate our recent medical marketing digital strategy results</a>, follow these healthcare marketing best practices to prep, act and improve your next digital ad campaign:

<h3>Healthcare Marketing Campaign Best Practices</h3>
<h4>Prep</h4>
<strong>Determine the Right Keyword Combinations</strong>. Look back and see what keywords were the most successful for you on similar branding or geo-focused campaigns in the past. Then, use those for your current healthcare digital advertising initiative.

<strong>Include Ad Extensions</strong>. Add a click-to-call extension or other ad extensions to your advertising to automatically improve your ad value, add urgency to your message, and encourage prospects to act at the same moment they see an ad. This is one easy way to get high-value prospects to reach out when they’re curious and most likely to make contact.

When we added a click-to-call extension to our client’s digital advertising, interested prospects could connect with the hospital’s call center directly and quickly learn more about how to set up an appointment. We also included a site link extension on their digital ads that directed prospects to a customized mobile-friendly webpage where they could fill out a form on the go to receive more info.

<strong>Use a Whitelist</strong>. Target only the top-performing sites for your brand. For every campaign you run, continually refine this list to make it more and more effective over time.

<strong>Make Private Marketplace Buys (PMPs)</strong>. Connect with premium preferred publishers so your display advertising can appear on well-known sites – WebMD, Healthline or AARP and the like – that resonate the most with your audience.

<h4>Act</h4>
<strong>Search First. Then Display</strong>. Start your search campaign first to ramp up and achieve better quality scores. Over time as quality scores improve, your message will move up in the search results, which will have a positive impact on your results as you launch your display campaign.

<strong>Test Your Healthcare Digital Ad Plan</strong>. To be as successful as you can be with your advertising initiative, A/B test different elements of your campaign on small audience segments before scaling to the wider group. This gives you the opportunity to try out and evaluate different strategies then easily adjust as needed for maximum impact upon full rollout. Also, this beta test approach can give you a quick bump in results, meaning you can increase your site traffic, campaign activities, and patient leads early on, all with less risk, time and money spent.

<strong>Work Your Healthcare Digital Ad Plan</strong>. Once you test your campaign, apply the lessons you learned to your real campaign. Then, you can move forward with audience targeting that is on point and with media that is pre-optimized to achieve results most effectively.

<h4>Improve</h4>
<strong>Optimize Your Search and Display Campaigns</strong>. Once you get your search and display campaigns underway, carefully analyze results – your reporting, human insight and machine learning – to make incremental improvements to your campaigns.

On all our campaigns, we optimize with our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/realvalue-advertising-platform/"">RealValue® machine-learning algorithm</a>. It automatically reviews browser and ad size data then bids higher on the best-performing combinations of both variables. This algorithm’s findings paired with our media buyers’ expertise is the winning combination to helping us know what audience and media inventory will best impact campaign results.

 	<li>With rising programming costs and the potential for billions in more revenue, <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/20/netflix-is-going-to-get-ads-sooner-or-later-say-executives-from-hulu-and-nbc.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">competitors predict Netflix will soon be saying yes to commercials</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">During a recent Cannes Lion panel, Linda Yaccarino, chairwoman of advertising sales and client partnerships at NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC said, “When you have to make more programming that’s not guaranteed to be a hit, you have to spend more money, you have to build your brand, you have to help the consumer discover your stuff — the price will go up for the subscription, and it would be logical to mitigate those increases to take ads.”</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">If Netflix did decide to incorporate commercials, just how they would do it is anyone’s guess. It’s possible they would stick to the traditional tried-and-true structures and formats, but maybe they would choose to innovate.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">Peter Naylor, head of ad sales at Hulu said during the panel, “The future of ad-supported media does not resemble what we’re doing today in terms of ad load or even ad shape. It can be interactive advertising or nonintrusive advertising. I think you’re going to see a lot of innovation from all these new OTT providers because we’re allowed to. We’re not married to the clock. Fifteen and 30-second ads were a product of linear TV. When everything’s on demand and served through an IP address, the ad experience is going to dramatically improve.”</p>

 	<li>Spotify is trying to make its advertising more valuable and generate more money by offering advertisers a more specific and better way to reach consumers: through podcast-based targeting.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">With only music targeting available before, advertisers got basic insight into desired customers: their general demographics, the music genre they consumed, the playlists they built. But, now <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681978/spotify-podcast-ad-targeting-launch"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">podcast ad targeting may be more beneficial to advertisers</a> since it can drill down to the podcast category people are interested in, revealing their interests and hobbies.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">The focus on podcasts will continue to be a priority at Spotify. A Spotify spokeswoman recently told The Verge that the company will continue to improve advertising around podcasts: “We aspire to develop a more robust advertising solution for podcasts that will allow us to layer in the kind of targeting, measurement, and reporting capabilities we have for ads that run alongside other content experiences like music and video.”</p>

 	<li>Out-of-home (OOH) media providers, such as Lamar, Clear Channel and others, are taking more static placements digital.

</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;"">“It’s dramatically different now than it was a year ago,” said Megan Halscheid, VP of media tech strategies at Publicis Media. “We’ve seen it in the interest from our clients and advertisers in terms of a shift.

They see the advantages of buying that programmatically.”</p>

Out-of-home (OOH) advertising has existed for decades through billboards, benches, bus wraps, indoor displays and elevator posters. But while OOH advertising inventory was previously only available in traditional mediums, advanced technology is opening the door for buyers and sellers to get in on new digital ad inventory, known as digital out of home (DOOH).

This is great news for digital marketers, but what do you need to know to take advantage? Get the inside scoop on DOOH here:

[/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]

<strong>What is DOOH and how big is it?</strong>

Reshaping the traditional advertising industry, DOOH typically includes digital displays in public areas, such as bus stations, airports, shopping malls, movie theaters, sports arenas, and more. And as <a href=""https://digiday.com/marketing/dramatically-different-now-year-ago-programmatic-buying-digital-billboards-growing/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">DOOH inventory continues to rise</a>, so does investment among advertisers.

Marketing research firm <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a> cites recent reports that show U.S. DOOH ad spending will increase by over 10% this year to $2.8 billion, accounting for nearly a quarter of the total OOH advertising spend. At the same time, total OOH ad spending will grow just 3.6% in 2019 — meaning the influx in DOOH dollars is coming from traditional OOH advertising budgets. Even though DOOH is experiencing healthy growth fueled by traditional budgets right now, it won’t be long before it steals budget from other digital media line items too.

<strong>How can you take advantage of DOOH’s benefits?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Reduced Creative Change Costs</strong> – Printing and installing traditional OOH advertising infrastructure is time-consuming and costly. Instead, use DOOH displays that are updated remotely within seconds. For instance, a pet food manufacturer can swap ads for chicken-based treats with venison kibble immediately after a salmonella outbreak hits the news.</li>
</ul>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Advanced Creative Variation</strong> – Visuals are often limited to static images and messages in traditional OOH advertising. Video inventory through DOOH can add variety and keep viewers interested. For example, an amusement park can feature a video from the front seat of their new roller coaster in ads to catch passersby’s attention and drive excitement around season pass sales.</li>
</ul>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Improved Engagement</strong> – While reach and branding potential are high for OOH advertising, especially in urban areas, there’s limited engagement with traditional placements and no way to prove viewers saw the message. However, special sensors and software in new DOOH displays allow consumers to interact with the ad, increasing engagement, activation and attribution efforts. This can be very impactful for businesses with brick-and-mortar locations, like a gym, to drive in-store visits. In this example, the ad could enable users to select from popular fitness classes via a touch screen and show directions to the nearest fitness studio based on their selection.</li>
</ul>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Enhanced Targeting</strong> – A traditional one-to-many targeting approach relies on broad third-party demographic and geographic data to reach the masses. <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/why-bring-programmatic-to-traditional-tv-ooh-and-audio-8"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Sophisticated digital targeting</a> employs first-, second- and third-party data on location information, traffic density and historical foot traffic patterns. Then, individual-level audience information gets paired back to consumers’ mobile devices as they pass by respective screens. So, a new Mexican restaurant can target inventory where the highest concentration of millennials who eat at Taco Bell at least once a week walk by during the lunch hour.</li>
</ul>
[/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Greater Relevancy</strong> – A single creative is typically used throughout the duration of a traditional OOH advertising campaign. But with DOOH, ad creatives can be customized based on real-time factors, such as weather, traffic, time of day, sports scores, and more. For instance, a car dealership can push truck and SUV ads on snowy days, run ads for sports cars when it’s sunny, and promote hybrid vehicles during rush hour commutes.</li>
</ul>

The number of cord-cutters, adults who abandon pay TV in favor of streaming services, is accelerating rapidly according to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a> and is expected to be more than one-fifth of the U.S. population by the end of 2022. But, when a telecommunications company offering fiber optic services, including fiber internet, fiber phone, and fiber IPTV asked us to help them expand their footprint and improve their online sales, we were up for the challenge.

To appeal to the <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-ott-video-forecast-2018"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">cord-cutting crowd</a>, we chose to promote our client’s reliable high-speed internet connections that power consumers’ streaming entertainment with an audience-first data strategy.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-is-people-based-marketing/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">“Audience first”</a> simply means before you ever think about creating your digital media campaign, you first should think about and understand your prospects well. What advertising creative, format, messaging and channels will most appeal to them and engage them enough to convert? Let your target audience shape and guide everything you do and how you do it.

<h3>How Our Audience-First Data Strategy Performed</h3>
For this programmatic campaign, we set out to drive new client signups and prove our client’s ad investment was worth it. So, we matched our media results throughout the campaign back to our client’s sales data to track and measure the return on ad spend (ROAS). How did our campaign ultimately perform?
<ul>
 	<li>We saw an average increase of 215% in signups for our client’s high-speed internet year over year and a 534% increase in overall average ROAS.</li>
 	<li>Because our team provided real-time analytics and attribution insights, the telecommunications company could truly start to make key business decisions based on data and maximize their results.</li>
 	<li>Our client also saw a halo effect, in which signups from other mediums, such as call centers, Salesforce, and programmatic, increased due to customers first seeing our digital advertising.</li>
</ul>

Examine your first-party data, such as your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/people-based-marketing-grow-crm-data/"">customer relationship management (CRM) data</a> and site data. This will tell you where your customers and leads go online, how they behave, what they’re interested in, and what they need. Knowing your prospects’ preferences and thoroughly understanding their online and offline behaviors can help you streamline your advertising efforts and minimize wasteful spending.

Then, tap into third-party data to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-tricks-discover-new-target-audience-online/"">widen your prospect net</a> and amplify your message beyond the leads you already have. This will help you find new people who resemble your ideal customer and who could be most receptive to your message and likely to buy.

<h3>Audience-First Data Strategy Step #2: Combine display and search to reach potential customers throughout the sales funnel.</h3>
<h4>Why Display?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>targeted, personalized, and measurable</li>
 	<li>diverse sizes, novel formats and interactive features</li>
 	<li>visually appealing and attention-grabbing way to introduce your brand to prospects as they browse the web</li>
 	<li>supports brand awareness and brand recall at the top of the funnel</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Search?</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>cost-effective way to compete with rivals and complement digital media efforts</li>
 	<li>gets eyeballs on your business: your URL, company description, at times even ad extensions, such as your address, map or click-to-call button</li>
 	<li>visible to shoppers at the bottom of the funnel who are actively searching, considering and looking to buy now</li>
 	<li>sends high-qualified traffic to your website and provides robust analytics to help improve your campaign results</li>
</ul>
<h4>Why Are They Better Together?</h4>
Integrating display and search so they work together makes your overarching campaign more cohesive. Combining the two lets you target your prospects from different angles – when they are and when they aren’t searching for you – and can improve your ROAS.

<h3>Audience-First Data Strategy Step #3: Use Display and Search Targeting to Your Advantage</h3>
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">Audience targeting</a> can get your advertising in front of the right group of people who exhibit the traits, interests and behaviors that are most valuable to your business. Whether running a display or search campaign, here are some targeting methods to try.
<h4>Display Targeting</h4>
<strong>Use Your CRM data to find eligible users through data matching with IP address targeting.</strong>

IP address targeting can reach people who work at a certain business or who are a part of the same household. You can run any name, physical address or zip code you know through an IP mapping system, and it will match up with an IP address so you can then target a person on a specific device.

For our client’s display campaign, we did just that. We looked at their first-party data and matched physical addresses within their serviceable areas to IP addresses. This allowed us to cost-effectively deliver personalized display advertising to eligible users.

<strong>Focus on site data to find and advertise again to users you want to convert with retargeting.</strong>

Track prospects who visited your site while they are browsing online. Re-advertise to them within a certain amount of time to encourage them to act, whether that’s to take a specific action or purchase your product or service. Typically, retargeting is done within a few minutes or up to a few hours after a prospect leaves your website to be most effective.

We implemented a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-pixel-tracking-works/"">layered pixel strategy</a> on our client’s website for our display campaign to capture users at every stage of the sales funnel. This allowed us to segment our best prospects who didn’t complete the signup process and then retarget them with specifically tailored display advertising later to nudge them one more time to convert. (Of course, we excluded those users who had already signed up.)

[/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id=""""]
<h4>Search Targeting</h4>
<strong>Optimize your campaign on your sales goal and focus on keywords that show intent to purchase (or intent to switch providers in this case) with zip code targeting.</strong>

Zip code targeting lets you home in on prospects based in a specific location, like in a residential area or across a few city blocks.

For our client’s search campaign, we used zip code targeting to concentrate on serviceable areas and leveraged the same pixels as the display campaign. We strived to target in-market users by optimizing on signups (not clicks) and focused on keywords that showed intent to switch providers so we could drive more orders.

When you follow these three steps – gather and analyze relevant data, combine the power of display and search, and include the right display and search targeting methods to reach your prospects – you’ll have the necessary components to start your own successful audience-first data strategy.

</ul>
<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/advanced-tv-bother-guide/"">Streamers</a> are not browsers. When video-on-demand subscribers don’t know what to watch, most don’t bother sifting through content to see what they may want to watch. They simply revert to what they know: watching traditional linear TV channels and their DVR recordings, according to Nielsen’s Q1 total audience report.

This is a problem for advertisers who most want to reach the 18- to 49-year-old demographic, which is precisely the one that appears to be the most overwhelmed by all the content available and the most indecisive about what to watch.

Peter Katsingris, SVP of audience insights at Nielsen said, “Too much choice leads to no choice at all. The challenge for media owners is to get their content or promotion of content to stand out and be sticky as a way to reel in eyeballs.”

</ul>
Newspapers, such as The Chicago Tribune, The Orlando Sentinel, The Sacramento Bee and The Kansas City Star, have a new way for consumers to get the morning headlines: through daily news briefings now available through voice apps on voice-activated devices, such as smart speakers.

Idalmy Carrera-Colucci, senior director of editorial operations at Tribune said, “We’re committed to bringing our readers the most compelling journalism on all of the platforms on which they expect us to be. That’s voice now.”

</ul>
Due to a robust economy and rising competition, travel companies are opening their wallets and spending more on advertising in the United States this year. In fact, eMarketer says its latest estimates show the travel industry’s overall digital ad spending will grow 21.4% to $10.86 billion this year.

One popular channel that travel advertisers use to reach consumers as they research destinations for quick getaways or family vacations is paid search.  Sarah Scherer, our product marketing manager here at Goodway Group told eMarketer, “Search is crucial for travel advertisers, and search engines have products that are specialized for the travel industry. It’s foundational for travel advertisers to have a presence on search.”

The travel industry must agree on building that strong foundation: According to eMarketer, the industry will spend $5.84 billion on search this year, which comes to 10.9% of total U.S. search spend.

</ul>
Consumers’ expectations when dealing with brands are changing. A recent survey of over 1,000 consumers by Drift and SurveyMonkey Audience found online shoppers want to communicate quickly with brands to solve issues.

Though email and phone remain the top two customer communication channels per the survey, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/alexa-programmatic-advertisers-marketers/"">chatbots</a> are gaining ground and offer brands another way to personally connect with people one-to-one to improve the customer experience. In fact, 14% of consumers surveyed said they would prefer using a chatbot over a webform.

Another interesting survey tidbit is consumers said they get frustrated when they’re not able to find the answers they need on brand websites and when brands don’t provide 24/7 customer service.

</ul>
Adobe’s new voice technology survey of 1,000 U.S. adults showed voice is growing: 48% of consumers are using voice for “general web searches” now and doing it more so on their smartphones rather than smart speakers.

Though consumers did complain about some of voice technology’s current pitfalls, for instance, accuracy and comprehension, 79% of those surveyed agreed voice still improves their quality of life, and 92% agreed voice technology saves them time.

Per the survey, here’s a quick summary of the top five ways voice technology is being used today:

Overall, the survey indicated voice’s future is looking bright. In fact, 90% of responders said they wanted voice on more devices, and 44% wanted a touch screen included in voice-activated devices. However, when asked how voice technology should evolve in the future, that result was mixed. Survey takers were torn: 49% said voice technology didn’t need more human qualities, like being able to show sympathy or demonstrate a good sense of humor.

Companies of all industries and sizes are experiencing a groundbreaking shift: New direct-to-consumer brands that have been around less than a year are challenging 100-year-old brands. Dollar Shave Club, BarkBox, Casper, and the list could go on and on. Driven by the success of online marketing, digital advertising has become the front line and a pivotal factor in determining a brand’s future.

So, it’s not surprising that marketers worldwide will <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">spend over $515 billion on digital advertising by 2024</a>. With total advertising investment in five years projected to be around $800 billion, we’re seeing the digitization of advertising budgets achieve meaningful scale. And yet, many CMOs are still struggling to communicate their digital marketing results in a way that gets leadership buy-in. In fact, recent research shows that over 80% of CMOs say aligning their marketing strategy with corporate goals keeps them up at night.

<a href=""https://www.prweb.com/releases/new_book_helps_cmos_to_flip_the_script_and_showcase_marketing_as_an_investment/prweb16584244.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Released last week</a>, our president Jay Friedman’s newest book <em><a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/prove_your_advertising_works/"">Prove Your Advertising Works</a></em> is specifically designed to flip the script and showcase marketing as a growth engine within a company. The book reveals the challenges CMOs face in harnessing, communicating and acting on digital marketing results and offers powerful tools for CMOs on how to discuss marketing’s results confidently and in terms that leadership values.

<strong>CMOs have spoken: The most important metrics to demonstrating the value of marketing and advertising to the enterprise are ROI, customer loyalty and retention, sales revenue, customer acquisition cost and customer lifetime value</strong>.

<strong>There are three common traits of successful in-housing – technology, data strategy, and meaningful spend levels to justify the time, effort and costs necessary</strong>. However, most brands are far better off partnering with a sophisticated agency that can keep their brand ahead of the market or choosing a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/bringing-programmatic-in-house"">hybrid approach</a>.

<h3>GOODWAY GROUP CELEBRATES 90: WHAT LIFE LESSONS DID YOUR GRANDFATHER, DAD AND UNCLE TEACH YOU?</h3>
<h4><img class=""alignleft wp-image-4857086831 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Goodway-Group-Celebrates-90-Years-Groundbreakers.svg"" alt=""Goodway Group Celebrates 90 Pull Quote 1"" width=""343"" height=""275"" />Treat Everyone Like Family</h4>
Everything in my grandfather’s life was about family more than the business. He taught me to love and take care of family and always impressed upon me that there wasn’t much difference between blood family and work family.

My uncle always treated his managers and banking partners like family too, taking them on fishing trips or inviting them to his home. He built amazing friendships, and that always impressed me.
<h4>Be Creative. Think Big. Think Out of the Box.</h4>
My dad was a dynamo and creative wonder, so fearless about chasing his dreams. Marketing was his hobby and his life. He loved marketing and advertising more than anyone I know. His charisma, his enthusiasm permeated any room, and his 24/7 attention to business became one of Goodway’s competitive advantages.

Both my dad and uncle dared me to be great and gave me the confidence to pursue opportunities well beyond the scope of what I could ever imagine. They taught me to always think big (conquer the universe, not just the world), brainstorm and go for the outrageous promotion or the biggest opportunity.
<h4>Work Hard, Play Hard</h4>
My uncle was a pipe-smoking financial and operational wizard. He was a fierce negotiator and taught me what a good, healthy business does to be successful. I learned a lot from him when I was young, and he always guided me in the right direction. In fact, I still learn from him today when we catch up about business.

He was also my fun uncle. He had great hobbies (fishing, skiing, boating, racing, flying, horseback riding, hunting, golfing, the list goes on and on) and loved adventure. I am grateful he took me along for the ride.

<h3>GOODWAY GROUP CELEBRATES 90: WHAT ARE YOUR BEST MEMORIES OF WORKING WITH YOUR FAMILY?</h3>
<h4>Poetry in Motion</h4>
Every trip with my dad to a major brand and new city was an adventure for me. We covered many cities and clients, and I looked forward to each trip and the chance to get out of the office. Seeing my dad pitch a room was like poetry in motion.

We would get an audience with a Fortune 500 CMO and close the deal, often on the first trip, my dad pitching and then me implementing the plans. That was such a thrill for me.

One time, we went to a General Electric (GE) meeting with their field team, and after my dad’s pitch, everyone lined up around the room to sign up for our program.
<h4>Goin’ Fishin’</h4>
Some of my best memories with my dad and uncle were taking print customers out fishing every Saturday in the summer in south Jersey.

I was young and had the job of being first mate. Every trip, I would bet my cousin who would get seasick first. Our job was to clean up the deck and care for those who got sick. When you get seasick, it’s like having the flu. So many of our guests would suffer with seasickness, but the minute we got back to the dock, they were ready to go on another weekend trip. That was the lure of a good fishing trip in the Atlantic.
<h4>Santa’s Unexpected Arrival</h4>
When I was very young, my dad always thought big and used to throw a Christmas party each year for the Goodway employees and families at our Philadelphia plant.

His idea of big was having Santa Claus land his helicopter on the front lawn of the plant and then hand out toys. Everyone didn’t know what to be more excited about, seeing a helicopter up close or getting goodies.

<h3>GOODWAY GROUP CELEBRATES 90: WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER TALKED ABOUT HIS LIFE, WHAT WAS HE MOST PROUD OF?</h3>
<h4><img class=""alignright wp-image-4857086829 size-full"" src=""https://goodwaygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Goodway-Group-Celebrates-90-Years-Drumbeat.svg"" alt=""Goodway Group Celebrates 90 Pull Quote 2"" width=""343"" height=""275"" />Shock and Awe</h4>
My grandfather recognized my dad’s and uncle’s intense entrepreneurial spirits and helped them chase their business dreams. He was very proud of how they grew the business so rapidly when they came aboard.

Unfortunately, I never got to work with my grandfather since he retired long before I started working. But I remember when I landed my first million-dollar print promotion and told him about it. He was very proud and amazed. He was used to selling smaller contracts, and this million-dollar deal really shocked him.

As Goodway Group celebrates 90 years, I know he would be in total awe of what we have accomplished today with our complete transformation from print to digital advertising.

<h3>GOODWAY GROUP CELEBRATES 90: WHAT ARE YOUR FAVORITE GOODWAY STORIES?</h3>
<h4>A Blizzard to Remember</h4>
When I first started working, we often went to Detroit to sell the Big Three. My dad always rented big luxury cars like Lincoln Continentals. One time, we landed in a blizzard and somehow made it to Chrysler headquarters in Highland Park.

We skidded on 75, and I thought we were going to get mangled. My dad kept saying, “Keep driving; keep going.”

When we got there, only a few cars were in the lot, even though Detroit clients were used to snowy conditions. As luck would have it, the Dodge CMO made it in, and with so few people in the building, we got to meet with him. He couldn’t believe we had made it in from Philadelphia when employees did not make it in from local towns. We had a great meeting, which led to our biggest multi-million-dollar print promotion job in our history to launch the Dodge Caravan.
<h4>NOT a Drill</h4>
We often had fire drills at our headquarters, and everyone would vacate except for my dad and me.

One day, unbeknownst to us, one of those drills could have turned deadly due to a gas leak, which I smelled.

I pushed my dad to leave the office, but he wouldn’t do it. Then five fully suited firemen came in and escorted my dad out. That’s what it took to take him from his work. Needless to say, no one could accuse him of not having a solid work ethic.
<h4>Goodway Vs. the Fire</h4>
We hit a low point in the 1940s when a fire leveled one of our printing plants.

My dad, uncle and grandfather drove up to the plant in the middle of the winter, and the fire hose streams froze up. It was traumatic and almost put us out of business.

Fortunately, they did wind up salvaging the printing equipment, which was great news since during the war, you couldn’t get parts. We were lucky enough to reopen by a publisher who gave us a variety of business that helped us expand our client base.

Google recently announced plans to <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9263492?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">sunset its average position metric</a>, previously used by advertisers to determine where their ad is shown in a search engine results page (SERP). To replace average position, Google recently released four new prominence metrics that better measure SERP visibility — absolute top impression rate, top impression rate, search absolute top impression share and search top impression share. While this change is exciting, how will Google’s new search metrics impact your ad campaigns? We’re one step ahead with all the answers you need.
<h3><strong>Google’s New Search Metrics Defined</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Absolute Top Impression Rate</strong> — the percentage of ad impressions that resulted from your ad appearing in the very first ad space on the SERP</li>
 	<li><strong>Search Absolute Top Impression Share</strong> — the number of impressions you’ve received from your ad appearing in the absolute top location compared to the estimated number of impressions you were eligible to receive in the absolute top location</li>
 	<li><strong>Top Impression Rate</strong> — the percentage of ad impressions that resulted from your ad appearing anywhere above the organic search results</li>
 	<li><strong>Search Top Impression Share</strong> — the number of impressions you’ve received from your ad appearing in any top location compared to the estimated number of impressions you were eligible to receive in the top location</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why is Google sunsetting average position?</h3>
The average position metric was designed to let advertisers know where their ads stand in ad auctions compared to other ads, not necessarily where they will appear on the SERP or which position offers you the best opportunity to maximize performance. In addition, new ad formats and devices have made defining average position more difficult in recent years. Google’s new search metrics offer advertisers a better gauge on their ad’s actual reach potential and a more accurate view of the ad’s position within the ad auction.

<h3>Who could be impacted by these changes?</h3>
Any advertiser running mobile or desktop paid search campaigns on Google.

<h3>When will these changes happen?</h3>
Starting late September 2019, Google will no longer report on average position for any advertiser.

<h3>How can you best leverage Google’s new search metrics results?</h3>
To get a better picture of your ad’s location, use the absolute top impression rate and top impression rate metrics. Whereas, search absolute top impression share and search top impression share will help you determine if there is any possibility for your ad to reach the top or absolute top of the SERP and optimize your bid for the position in which it has the best chance to convert.

<h3>What should you do to ensure your campaigns continue performing well?</h3>
While you should be aware of this change, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/do-not-google-own-keywords-sem-strategies/"">there is no action needed from you</a> at this time. Google makes changes to its advertising metrics and platforms throughout the year.

What was Jay’s inspiration behind this guide? Jay said the idea stemmed from CMOs and advertisers across the digital advertising landscape who kept telling him they longed for a blueprint on how to show the C-suite — CEOs, CFOs, and the like — just how measurable digital advertising is and how it can be an important driver of growth and financial success for any organization. After having this conversation time and again, Jay took it as a sign. He realized he was in the unique position with the necessary knowledge and ability to actually make this wished-for blueprint happen, and the book was born.

</ul>
Nielsen now can measure U.S. Amazon Prime video streams via TVs (including connected and smart devices) through its Subscription Video on Demand Content Ratings solution. Having this new Amazon streaming data benefits both networks and studios because they can learn more about the content they produce – who’s viewing it, how it’s being consumed, and how it’s performing.

“This is a significant milestone for Nielsen, especially considering the upcoming high-profile streaming service launches,” Brian Fuhrer, SVP, Product Leadership, Nielsen said. “We think the addition of Amazon Prime Video will allow rights owners an added ability to understand both the size, as well as the composition, of their streaming audiences relative to other platforms or programs.” He continued, “Beyond that, making this enhancement re-affirms our commitment to continuous improvement and to being the one media truth of an increasingly fragmented video landscape.”

</ul>
In his recent AdExchanger column, our president Jay Friedman discussed 30-second TV spots and how he believes their cost-per-point (CPP) and cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) growth rates will continue to exceed inflation.

Jay said he thinks nothing is better than TV when it comes to supply and desirable format, though other video options abound today: “Time spent watching live-plus-time-shifted TV has <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/05/when-did-tv-watching-peak/561464/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">steadily fallen</a> since 2010,” he said. “Sure, that lost time has been replaced and even augmented by video <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/average-us-time-spent-with-mobile-in-2019-has-increased"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">on other devices</a>, but six-second buffer ads and skippable video don’t have the same impact of a 30-second, full-screen, uninterrupted ad right in the middle of desirable content.”

</ul>
According to eMarketer’s latest U.S. spending forecast on search, Google will continue to remain the major player in search, but its share and revenues will likely fall while Amazon’s, among others, will rise over the next two years. For instance, Google will have a 73.1% search market share by the end of this year but will only hold on to 70.5% of the market by 2021. (In other news, find out how <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/googles-new-search-metrics"">Google’s new search metrics</a> will impact your ad campaigns.) But Amazon’s share – though much smaller – is likely to be 12.9% this year and is expected to grow to 15.9% by 2021.

What are Amazon’s key strengths that nab more market share? Nicole Perrin, eMarketer principal analyst, said: “Amazon’s ad business has attracted massive increases in spending because advertisers can reach consumers during product queries, a time when they’re ready to buy.” She continued, “Amazon has also rolled out better measurement and targeting tools, making it even more attractive for advertisers.”

</ul>
Google will no longer be relying on cookies in Display and Video 360. Instead, it’s taking a new approach to ad frequency control, which could also roll out to Google Ads in the future.

The new feature will use machine learning to analyze traffic patterns when third-party cookies are available and build models to predict patterns when a cookie isn’t present.

Rahul Srinivasan, Google’s product manager for ads privacy, said, “This allows us to estimate how likely it is for users to visit different publishers who are serving the same ads through Google Ad Manager. Then, when there is no third-party cookie present, we’re able to optimize how often those ads should be shown to users.”

</ul>
The latest version of Apple’s Safari browser is thwarting publishers’ paywalls. Now, when private browsing mode is on, users can get an unlimited-access pass to paywall content since publishers can’t detect or monitor just how much users are consuming.

Though, publishers aren’t sure how Apple’s privacy update will impact business yet, they are concerned, especially since it’s already a difficult task to get paying subscribers.

“This will lead to a hard paywall for all readers and also make it more difficult to monetize content,” said Danielle Coffey, SVP of strategic initiatives at the News Media Alliance. “While we’re interested in protecting our readers’ privacy, we still need a return on our investments to sustain quality journalism.”

We’ve all learned the life lesson that there can be “too much of a good thing.” Although some would argue it’s much less addictive than candy, data has the potential to fall into this same category as the amount we have at our fingertips would have been unimaginable 20 years ago. So, it’s no big surprise that data is one of the fastest growing segments in advertising, but with this explosive growth has come <a href=""https://www.iab.com/insights/glossary-of-terminology/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a dictionary’s worth of terminology</a> and data strategy <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/marketing-acronym-glossary"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">acronyms</a> to learn.

Understanding what people are talking about when they start dropping the alphabet soup in conversations can make all the difference in becoming an expert on data strategy. Let’s start with the basics. Get access to all the data strategy acronyms you need to know now; but fair warning, you might become a know-it-all after reading this blog post.

<h4>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h4>
Passed by U.S. legislators in June 2019, the CCPA establishes new privacy requirements for businesses that operate, buy, sell or receive consumer information in California. CCPA requires organizations to provide transparency in how they’re collecting, sharing and using consumer data. As part of the law, consumers can specifically request this data, and companies must be able to provide it in a digestible format.

 	<li>Makes data selections based on a specific customer identifier (e.g., email address).</li>
 	<li>Persistently stores date/time.</li>
 	<li>Stores data in a single place.</li>
 	<li>Allows for more flexibility when building customer audiences.</li>
 	<li>Is used to enhance and mature your relationship with the customer.</li>

<h4>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</h4>
Prospect or customer information collected is typically managed in a CRM system. This data is often referred to as CRM data. This first-party data can include both offline data (e.g., customer data ranging from coupon mailers to loyalty cards) and online data (e.g., customer data from online activities ranging from website visits to online transactions). Both the offline and online data can contain PII (e.g., name, email address, phone number, etc.).

We often get questions from clients about how their CRM data stacks up.

<h4>Data Management Platform (DMP)</h4>
A unifying platform to collect, organize and activate first-, second- and third-party audience data from any source, including online, offline, mobile and beyond. The DMP pushes audience data to other platforms, such as DSPs, SSPs and ad exchanges to facilitate targeted advertising, personalized messaging and content customization.

A DMP can create fuller customer profiles by centralizing data sets that otherwise would be siloed. Then by <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/activate-data-witha-dmp/"">linking your DMP into a DSP</a>, you can boost advertising ROI and more accurately target the right person with the right message.

<h4>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>
European legislation that aims to ensure protection and privacy for all individuals within the European Union by imposing rules on controlling and processing PII. GDPR seeks to standardize data protection laws across all 28 EU countries. Under GDPR, the definition of personal data was extended to include pseudonymous data (e.g., online identities, IP addresses and mobile device IDs). This requires companies to gain approval from European customers to collect, use or share their data for advertising purposes.

It’s important to note that while the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/current-state-GDPR-compliance"">road to GDPR compliance</a> has been challenging for some companies, it has had positive impacts on the industry, too. The new regulation increases transparency and requires companies to review their data handling and processing procedures – which is just good business all around. And while GDPR is still in its infancy, there is good reason to celebrate and embrace the new level of cooperation it achieved among ad tech stakeholders.

At some point, every marketer wonders: Does paid social work? With a solid social media presence, our quick-service-restaurant (QSR) client had a hunch social media ads were making an impact on their business, but they wanted to know for sure. They wanted to know if paid social was in fact driving customers into their 600 brick-and-mortar locations around the country day after day. Rather than continuing to trust a hunch or go with their gut, they took action and turned to Goodway Group to help match their social media performance to real-life business results. Here’s how:

[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=""1_1"" layout=""1_1"" spacing="""" center_content=""no"" link="""" target=""_self"" min_height="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" background_color="""" background_image="""" background_image_id="""" background_position=""left top"" background_repeat=""no-repeat"" hover_type=""none"" border_color="""" border_style=""solid"" border_position=""all"" box_shadow=""no"" box_shadow_blur=""0"" box_shadow_spread=""0"" box_shadow_color="""" box_shadow_style="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset="""" last=""true"" border_sizes_top=""0"" border_sizes_bottom=""0"" border_sizes_left=""0"" border_sizes_right=""0"" type=""1_1"" first=""true""][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]
<h3>Leveraging Facebook Store Visit Ads</h3>
Over half of frequent restaurant-goers turn to their smartphone first when deciding where to eat, so mobile Facebook ads are a perfect fit for this industry. Facebook store visit ads let you promote one, or a few, or all your physical locations (such as retail shops, restaurants, gyms or salons) in the same or different cities and include personalized content, such as sales and special offers, to boost store visits. These ads can each include custom info, such as an individual restaurant’s address, phone number, hours, and map. They can also include call-to-action buttons, such as Get Directions, so people can visit the closest nearby store.

Most importantly, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/goals/promote-local-business"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Facebook store visit ads</a> match users who were exposed to an ad on Facebook and visited a restaurant location (for users who have opted in to allow Facebook to track their smartphone location) — enabling our QSR client to unmistakably tie back customer visits to their marketing efforts.

<h3>Using Hyperlocal Targeting</h3>
When it comes to traditional media planning, buyers know different parts of the country typically have different cultures and lifestyles that influence the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. But in today’s digital and mobile world, we can take a hyperlocal approach to reach your ideal audience, wherever they are.

Geofencing, a specific type of hyperlocal targeting tactic, creates a virtual perimeter to prospect new customers and increase in-store foot traffic for advertisers. It allows advertisers to reach people near specific latitude and longitude coordinates for your store locations. For other use cases, you can also use geofencing to target:
<ul>
 	<li>an audience for your upcoming event to help attract the right customers and boost attendance.</li>
 	<li>competitors’ locations to tell shoppers or customers why they should shop or visit you.</li>
 	<li>airports, hotels, museums, and other attractions to reach tourists who may have time on their hands and could visit if they knew you and were interested in what you have to offer.</li>
</ul>
In this case, we set up a three- to five-mile geofence around each of our client’s restaurants in more than 60 DMAs, with some cities having hundreds of individual locations. Our virtual perimeter then used the GPS information on mobile phones and apps to target and serve ads to anyone who crossed the geofence threshold, ensuring impressions were delivered to customers close enough to visit.

<h3>Putting Paid Social to the Test</h3>
Going with Facebook store visit ads can give advertisers <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/digital-marketing-results-book-cmos"">measurable results</a>. They show real-time measurement signals, such as info shared by people who have their mobile devices’ Location Services turned on and third-party satellite imagery and mapping data that show a physical location’s boundaries. What’s more, Facebook is able to estimate the number of times people visit locations after seeing ads one day, seven days, and 28 days after a person clicks on an ad. It’s also able to exclude store employees and those people who simply pass by a location.

Drumroll, here’s the verdict: Paid social media does work. It is effective at <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/multi-location/"">driving more foot traffic and sales for advertisers with physical retail locations</a>. In fact, by combining both Facebook store visits ads and hyperlocal targeting, we ended up generating more than 653,000 store visits for our QSR client at an average cost of $0.61 a visit!

We got this added bonus too. Facebook was able to track customers’ attributes and behaviors – such as age, online activities, and customers’ distance from a restaurant location when they saw the ad. Through the campaign, our client could better understand their ideal audience and use that information to enhance targeting on future campaigns.

Instinctively, you might think putting your digital marketing budget toward only one channel, making a big splash in one place, is the right move for the most impact, especially when your budget is limited. But to truly boost your campaign performance, diversify. Combine multiple digital advertising channels – such as <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/googles-new-search-metrics"">search</a>, <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/digital-display-advertising-2019"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">display</a> and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/does-paid-social-work"">social</a> – to extend your advertising coverage so you can reach your entire target audience, no matter where they are or where they happen to be in the purchase cycle.

Here’s how. Follow this 5-step holistic marketing formula:

<h3>Lay the foundation with paid search.</h3>
Make paid search the bedrock of your campaign. When highly engaged in-market consumers at the bottom of the advertising funnel are actively searching for what you offer, weighing their options, and looking to buy now, you can engage them at the right moment.
<h4>Quick Tips</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Set up your keyword groups based on every aspect of your business: your branding, competitors, and all the terminology relevant to who you are and what you do.</li>
 	<li>Determine your conversion actions, such as calls, website clicks and form fills.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Add digital channels on top to widen your advertising net.</h3>
Multiple digital advertising channels have more power than one alone. To build on paid search’s firm foundation, add digital advertising options, such as display banners and social. Layering these on top of paid search is effective because it creates brand awareness and primes interested consumers to search for your brand, which increases people’s likelihood to convert.

For instance, when our healthcare client incorporated search, display banners and social into one holistic digital advertising campaign, they increased their paid search click-through rate and conversion rate by more than 30% than running paid search alone!
<h4>Quick Tips</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>If adding display banners,
<ul>
 	<li>consider employing cross-device behavioral targeting to find your target demo and people interested in what you offer.</li>
 	<li>use keyword contextual targeting to capture people on niche websites searching for terms related to your products or services.</li>
 	<li>employ geo-retargeting to remind consumers in your geographic area about your local offers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>If adding a paid social component,
<ul>
 	<li>ramp up both your organic and paid social presence on popular platforms like Facebook and Instagram to better connect with and build rapport with your target audience, at any time of day, in the place they like to spend their time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Analyze current converters to better understand your target audience.</h3>
Find customers and prospects similar to your converting audience. Then weave these consumer insights into your media plan. For instance, pick the tactic mix that most appeals to your target audience for better results.
<h4>Quick Tips</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Try using behavioral targeting segments for social that are similar to those for display banners.</li>
 	<li>Use look-alike modeling to find those users similar to your converters to expand your audience.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Review the channel data to spot surprising finds and trends.</h3>
Examine each digital advertising channel’s data to make connections or new discoveries and then apply what you learn.

Our healthcare client found the majority of paid search conversions came from younger and middle-aged women, which was expected. But something else caught them by surprise and gave them an untapped market to pursue: A quarter of all their paid search clicks generated in their campaign came from men!

Optimizing your campaign based on channel insights can also provide significant savings. When our healthcare client applied their social campaign’s best age demos to their display banner campaigns, they were able to decrease their display banner effective cost per action (eCPA) by $5. On the other hand, when they noticed their display banner converters showed a strong interest in healthy foods, they were able to quickly optimize their social channel for better success by adding similar segments.
<h4>Quick Tips</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Review advertising channel data to learn about untapped markets to pursue.</li>
 	<li>Personalize your digital advertising to make it more effective across channels.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Apply data insights to continually improve your campaign performance.</h3>
As mentioned above, optimizing your campaign regularly based on what your data is telling you is vital. For example, when our healthcare client reviewed their data insights, they also found social converters were younger, married and highly educated women while display banner converters were middle-aged parents. Having this information helped our client determine the right tactic mix for each audience.
<h4><strong>Quick Tip</strong></h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Use data insights to guide your media plan’s tactic mix and campaign improvements over time.</li>

<h3>Do one more crucial thing before implementing this holistic digital marketing formula.</h3>
Before you put this 5-step formula in place, select a single partner to manage your holistic digital marketing campaign.

If you don’t? Our president Jay Friedman says <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/digital-advertising-strategy-is-costing-you/"">working with multiple vendors is like scattering a dandelion in the wind</a>. “All the performance intelligence about your brand — what media works, what audiences work, their seasonality — gets seen by multiple vendors,” he says. “These vendors have turnover like anyone else, but the impact on your business is multiplied when you’ve spread knowledge around. Their employees go to other places and have no reason not to share this knowledge with your competitors!”

<h4>Quick Tips</h4>
Look for a single vendor who can do the following:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Take an audience-centric approach</strong>: Will they let your target audience dictate the campaign?</li>
 	<li><strong>Surmount channel silos</strong>: Can they easily share data and insights across ad channels? Do their teams share one vision and the same goals? Can they create a cohesive campaign and also make smart improvements on the fly?</li>
 	<li><strong>Create relevant messaging for every channel</strong>: Do they understand the nuances of each digital ad channel? Can they speak to each channel’s audience to drive the maximum conversions?</li>
 	<li><strong>Build a successful campaign</strong>: Are they easy to communicate with and to work with? What types of expertise, industry-leading tools, technology and reporting can they provide and integrate to set you up for success?</li>
</ul>

Want to be as proactive, productive, and prepared as possible with your 2020 marketing? Here are the three tasks Amanda recommends you do now:

<h3>2020 Marketing: Play to Your Audience</h3>
Getting quality third-party data is getting harder and more expensive. As a result, Amanda says to never underestimate the advantage of owning your own audience. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">First-party data</a> is king today and having it and growing it can make all the difference whether your business dies or thrives.
<h4>Key To-Do-List Tasks</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Connect with and engage your own pool of current customers and prospects regularly by sending more frequent and personalized niche emails to those already on your list.</li>
 	<li>Focus on marketing campaigns, promotions, and events that will build up your first-party data. To improve email open rates and clicks, what do you need? Amanda says work email addresses. Content sent to these in-boxes automatically has a greater chance of being read, simply because the messages that appear here are typically required reading for those wanting to perform well on the job.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2020 Marketing: Embrace the New Privacy Laws</h3>
With the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in place and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) on the horizon, some marketers may be anxious about how <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/7-data-strategy-acronyms-explained"">these laws</a> will limit them and force them to change how they operate. However, Amanda thinks it’s all a matter of mindset.
<h4>Key To-Do-List Tasks</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Look at these new laws and regulations in a new light and consider how they will ultimately make your business better. Of course, it’s a bit of a downside to change the way you think about, collect, and use information about your audiences. But here's a big win: Investigate your use of data; then craft compliant policies focused only on the data you will use so you can create better brand experiences, better user experiences. Amanda says, “It’s all about consumers understanding and valuing what you do with their data.”</li>
 	<li>View the upcoming CCPA as a national law rather than a state one and change how you operate accordingly. Amanda says you should act now rather than wait. After all, California won’t be alone for long in how they regulate data privacy, especially considering 17 other states are currently mulling similar laws.</li>

<h3>2020 Marketing: Get Full Buy-in Before Launching New Tech</h3>
Having the budget is important, of course. But Amanda says one thing is even more so when rolling out new technology: being ready.
<h4>Key To-Do-List Tasks</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Rather than getting your technology buy-in just from the leadership team at the top, get it from the entire company.</li>

</ul>
Google My Business has rolled out a new feature: Up top on local business profiles, it’s now featuring reviews more visibly by showing them in a carousel format.

A Google spokesperson confirmed the change to Search Engine Land, saying, “We’ve begun showing Reviews and Q&amp;A that are relevant to the user’s query on the business profile. These are surfaced when there is a sufficient number of high-quality reviews/Q&amp;A for the specific place related to the user’s query.”

What is the ad tech industry’s main 2020 goal? In his recent AdExchanger Data-Driven Thinking article, our president Jay Friedman says it's preparing for a cookieless future.

He said, “When the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) goes into effect Jan. 1, it will launch independent ad tech on its own type of 'gap year' in which it must interpret the law’s evolving nuances and focus on innovation before it’s ready for the big day – not for college but for replacing behavioral targeting in a meaningful way.""

</ul>
When it comes to consumer research and target demographics, Susan Schwallie, executive director of food and beverage consumption for the NPD Group in Chicago, thinks Generation X is often forgotten. She told QSR Magazine, “It is an average generation and very representative of the total population.”

But fast-casual and quick-service restaurants should definitely be taking notice: The 65 million Gen Xers in the U.S. today spend more on food than any other generation. Also, market research company Datassential found 80% of the time these people are looking for these types of restaurants over full-service ones.

What is it exactly that Gen X customers are expecting when it comes to a dining experience? Schwallie says it comes down to having customizable options and being a good value. That's why build-your-own meals, buffets, or combo meals are particularly popular with this generation. Gen Xers also want restaurants to be family-friendly, trustworthy, and healthy.

Whether your business is B2B, B2C, D2C, or some other combination of alphabet soup, driving in new leads is always top of mind. But in today’s ever-evolving ad landscape, it can be tough to know which channel will bring the best results. Many B2B brands instinctively turn to LinkedIn for lead generation. But we often remind these clients not to overlook the power and reach of Facebook’s new lead ads.

For example, one of our B2B cable industry clients recently gave Facebook lead ads a try based upon our recommendation, and they were shocked by the results. If you are still skeptical about Facebook lead ads, check out our quick Q&amp;A to learn how they work and how we can help make them work for you too.

<h3>What Are Facebook Lead Ads?</h3>
A <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/ads/lead-ads"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Facebook lead ad</a> lets you create an ad for your product or service, plus a customized form to go with it. For instance, if you want to encourage prospects to download a guide, request a cost estimate, sign up for a product demo, or enroll in a program or an event, you can create and set up a customized form that will instantly collect answers and contact info (name, email address, phone number, and the like) from high-quality prospects who may be interested in your product or service.

<h3>How Do Facebook Lead Ads Work?</h3>
When a user scrolls through Facebook, sees your ad, and taps on it, your customized form pops up pre-populated with the user’s contact info from Facebook. This makes submitting the form quick and easy for prospects since most of the work has already been done for them. Also, the experience is seamless for users because the form allows users to stay in the Facebook app rather than redirecting to an external landing page.

<h3>Why Should You Use Facebook Lead Ads?</h3>
<h4>Benefit #1: Build Brand Awareness and Reach</h4>
Facebook lead ads can help you build both brand awareness and reach at the top of the funnel. You can find the people most important to and most interested in your business and give them what they want: a simple way to respond to your message from any device. The seamlessness of Facebook lead ads helps discourage form abandoners.
<h4>Benefit #2: Tailor the Form to Suit Your Brand</h4>
Facebook lets you customize the form, too. Capture the contact info most important for your team’s follow-up – be it a phone number, personal email address, or business address. And you can ask your audience custom qualifying questions to learn more about their level of interest.
<h4>Benefit #3: Get Your Leads However You Want Them</h4>
When users submit the form, you can download your new leads through Facebook or have them sent directly to your customer relationship management (CRM) platform, such as MailChimp or Salesforce, so your sales team can immediately follow up.

<h3>How Can Facebook Lead Ads Help You Reach More Customers?</h3>
Facebook lead ads help you leverage your first-party data – the customer data gold mine you already own – to the fullest as well as gather the third-party data you need to expand your prospect pool. To make the most use of your first-party data, start with these tactics and expand your reach:
<ul>
 	<li>Use your first-party CRM data, the info you’ve already collected on customers, to build <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/facebooks-third-party-data-changes/"">look-alike</a> audiences within Facebook.</li>
 	<li>Examine your other <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/strategies-performing-ads-facebook-campaign/"">Facebook ad conversions</a> and then use those insights to build additional look-alike segments.</li>
 	<li>Retarget people who abandoned your lead ad form without submitting it. Retargeting is so effective because you’re getting back in front of people who are familiar with you and who have already shown interest in the past.</li>
</ul>
Once you’ve squeezed all you can from your first-party data, expand your prospect pool using third-party data to reach similar people who may be interested in your message.
<ul>
 	<li>Take advantage of Facebook interest segment targeting.</li>
 	<li>Reach your preferred business segments, such as small business owners. (Our client used <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/what-makes-us-different/"">Goodway Group</a>’s preferred partnership with PushSpring, a provider of device-level targeting data,  to reach these segments.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How Can Facebook Lead Ads Improve Your Results?</h3>
Facebook lead ads can improve the customer experience just like it did for our cable industry client:
<h4>Our Client’s Advertising: “Before”</h4>
Before testing Facebook lead ads, our client started out advertising with Facebook conversion ads. These ads redirected prospective customers to a landing page where the prospects could share more info about their needs via a two-step validation process. This generated some positive results, but we knew our client could do better.
<h4>Our Client’s Advertising: “After”</h4>
It wasn’t until they started running Facebook lead ads that their lead generation really took off. Facebook lead ads let our client’s audience avoid the tedious two-step form submission process. And instead of having to leave Facebook to submit the form on another website, prospects could quickly and easily do it within the Facebook site or app. Then, we helped our client set it up so their leads would go directly to the right team for quick follow-up. After making the switch to Facebook lead ads, our client’s lead generation vastly improved:
<ul>
 	<li>They decreased their effective cost per lead (eCPL) by 73% …</li>
 	<li>AND they achieved a 6-fold average increase in leads!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Is a Metric?</h3>
Metrics are numbers or ratios that track the status of business processes. They provide insights but aren’t as relevant to measuring your performance related to your business objective.

Need some inspiration on what metrics you should consider measuring?

<h3>What Is a KPI?</h3>
KPI stands for key performance indicator. Think of a KPI as a compass: It can tell you if you’re headed in the right direction toward your goal and also how you’re doing along the way – whether you’re on track, falling short or exceeding it.

KPIs
<ul>
 	<li>are actionable,</li>
 	<li>give you a baseline to measure performance,</li>
 	<li>and tell you where to focus your team’s time, energy, expertise and talent to accomplish your objective – whether that's to increase revenue, grow new customers, send more traffic to your website, get more social media followers or something else entirely.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Metrics vs. KPIs: How Are They Different?</h3>
Metrics only become KPIs when you apply and compare data to your goals. So KPIs are metrics, but not all metrics are KPIs. KPIs are the relevant and insightful metrics you select, monitor and track to help you make informed decisions about your marketing initiatives.

<h3>A 5-Point Checklist for Creating Smarter Goals and Digital Marketing KPIs</h3>
After that quick refresher, here’s a 5-point checklist to setting goals and KPIs for any upcoming marketing project or campaign:
<ul>
 	<li>
<h4>#1: Ask the Right Questions.</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goal-prioritization-programmatic/"">What do you want to do and why</a>? This can help you easily generate the right goals for your team.</li>
 	<li>When writing goals, remember to make them clear (don’t use jargon), short (one line if possible), and <a href=""https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/smart-goal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">SMART</a> (specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timebound).</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>#2: Find Your Target.</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Every goal needs a target – that numeric value that shows what you hope to achieve and by when. A target shows you what to aim for and whether you’ve hit the mark. It’s what gives KPIs the power to gauge your goal’s performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li>Take this example: Say you achieved a sales volume of 5,000 widgets by a set date. That seems good, but how can you be sure? You don’t have any reference point. But if you know your target was 3,500 widgets by that set date, then you know you significantly surpassed your goal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>#3: Be Careful What You Measure.</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Before tying KPIs to any goal, ask yourself these questions:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>
 	<li>How do you envision success?</li>
 	<li>Which metrics align with your particular goal and support what you’re trying to accomplish?</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Digital marketing KPIs – such as ROI, website page views, cost per lead, customer lifetime value, to name a few – abound, but our data insights analysts suggest having two to five logical and relevant KPIs at a time per goal that are actionable as well as easy to measure and quantify.</li>
 	<li>To put together what you’ve learned, let’s look at this digital marketing initiative example:
<ul>
 	<li>Objective: Grow B2B sales leads</li>
 	<li>Goal: Grow company’s subscriber list by 50% this year</li>
 	<li>Marketing Initiative: Develop and post 5 engaging and evergreen lead magnets on website landing pages, all free to download in exchange for contact info</li>
 	<li>Potential KPIs: % increase in website’s subscriber conversion rate; % change in landing page views; % change in lead magnet downloads</li>
 	<li>Owner: Marketing Manager</li>
 	<li>Frequency Check: Monthly</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>#4: Keep Tabs on Your Results.</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Assign a point person to analyze each of your goals and KPI performance regularly, whether that be daily, weekly, monthly or at another interval. The specific timing you can select is flexible and should depend on what you’re tracking.</li>
 	<li>To analyze results, either take a manual approach and piece together the data for review into a report, spreadsheet or slides or set up an automated dashboard that can do the work for you and can always give you an at-a-glance view of where you stand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>
<h4>#5: Be Willing to Change.</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Goals and KPIs are fluid so will change over time. If something isn’t working and needs shifting, switch up your strategy and experiment. Retiring old KPIs in favor of introducing new ones is natural. Keep only those that serve you best and can best gauge your performance over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Justin Schuh, Google’s director for Chrome engineering, said, “This is our strategy to re-architect the standards of the web, to make it privacy-preserving by default.” He added, “There’s been a lot of focus around third-party cookies, and that certainly is one of the tracking mechanisms, but that’s just a tracking mechanism, and we’re calling it out because it’s the one that people are paying attention to.”

</li>
</ul>
NBC Peacock doesn’t want to be like Netflix or Disney+. The new streaming service simply wants to complement cable and show why NBC still reigns and the value of linear TV.

Launching July 15, Peacock plans to provide a nice balance of both live programming and current NBC shows and popular older TV shows and Universal movies, available through three pricing tiers: Peacock Free, a $5 a month ad-supported option (with special benefits for Comcast customers), and Peacock Premium, a $10 a month ad-free option.

“This is a very exciting time for our company, as we chart the future of entertainment,” said Steve Burke, chairman of NBCUniversal. “We have one of the most enviable collections of media brands and the strongest ad sales track record in the business. Capitalizing on these key strengths, we are taking a unique approach to streaming that brings value to customers, advertisers and shareholders.”

</li>
</ul>
Facebook’s plan to bring ad products, such as Status Ads, to WhatsApp in 2020 is on hold, and the team once working on it has been disbanded.

When asked about this development, a WhatsApp spokesperson said, “Ads in Status remains a long-term opportunity for WhatsApp. We believe it is a great way for people to discover a business that’s important to them, although we do not have a more specific timeline we can provide. At the moment, the team is focused on building new features to help businesses achieve success, as well as providing payments in a number of countries. For example, late last year, WhatsApp launched catalogs to help businesses showcase their goods and services right within the app.”

</li>
</ul>
As we touched on in a prior blog, VIZIO is taking the plunge into ad sales. But now here’s why: It wants to have more control over advertising and the advertiser and user experience.

What can VIZIO offer advertisers? According Mike O’Donnell, senior vice president at VIZIO, it’s something they want most: rich multilevel data. He explained, “If you just want to find incremental audiences tied to reach and frequency, we've got that. We've got data that can tell you what VIZIO audiences are watching. We can tell you what they aren't watching too, so you can easily target the people you missed in order to drive incremental reach. We  can also provide digital type solutions. And by that I mean, our data gives advertisers the ability to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">reach very specific audiences</a>. So if you need to buy against say ‘dog owners in Minneapolis,’ we've got solutions that can deliver that specific audience to you.”

Mike also shared how VIZIO will cater to users: “On a more macro level, we know that more and more consumers are <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"">moving to streaming</a>, so we want to make sure we have all the right content available for them, both from a subscription standpoint, and from a free ad supported standpoint. As <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-questions-to-ask-before-buying-advanced-tv/"">cord cutting grows</a>, we know that most of our customers are going to be looking to us to supply them with free ad-supported content. So our goal here is to be able to give that to them by making our platform very attractive for those sorts of apps. It’s good for them, it’s good for us, and ultimately, it’s good for our customers.”

<h4>Breaking News Headline #5: <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-why-it-wont-challenge-google-facebook-by-selling-ads-2020-1"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Netflix: Why They Won’t Sell Advertising (the Real Reasons)</a></h4>
</li>
</ul>
Netflix has always refused to sell advertising, but here are the reasons why.

Earlier this month, CEO Reed Hastings said building a meaningful advertising business and challenging Google, Facebook, and Amazon would be too expensive. He said, ""There's not easy money there. They're integrating so much data from so many sources ... To keep up with those giants, you've got to spend very heavily on that and track locations and all kinds of other things that we're not interested in doing.""

Reed gave another reason Netflix doesn’t want to get into the ad game: It doesn’t want to deal with ad targeting and its increasing regulations.

However, though Netflix isn’t selling advertising, it’s still working with advertisers in clever ways, through product placements, brand partnerships and consumer products.

Five years ago, media buyers were running on every ad exchange possible without much control over where and who bids and impressions were going out to, meaning the exchange picked the best supply path. Today, buyers are ready to have greater control over the supply chain, and many are demanding a solution. Enter ad tech’s latest buzzword: supply path optimization.

<h3>What Is Supply Path Optimization?</h3>
Supply path optimization (SPO) identifies the right path to bid and win inventory at the best price, empowering you to take ownership and accountability for your supply chain. SPO’s goal is to help buyers access quality inventory and minimize wasted impressions.

<h3>What Does Supply Path Optimization Do?</h3>
<a href=""https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/why-ad-tech-shouldnt-be-skittish-about-supply-path-optimization/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adweek</a> says it well: SPO cuts the clutter between media buyers and publishers hungry to sell inventory. By clutter, they mean extraneous sellers, URLs and companies who demand their own fees along the ad supply path and stand between the buyer and a publisher. Think of SPO as <a href=""https://www.marthastewart.com/1106009/konmari-trendy-new-organizing-method"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Marie Kondo’s KonMari Method</a> for the ad tech industry. In the same way you might banish clutter from your closet and only keep clothing and items that bring you joy, media buyers can banish clutter and tidy up the ad tech industry to receive higher quality inventory, lower fees and more transparency in programmatic advertising.

<h3>How Do You Create a Solid Supply Path Optimization Strategy?</h3>
<h4>Root Out Ad Fraud Continually</h4>
Ad fraud includes non-human traffic that is intentionally misrepresented or is never seen. Detect, analyze and eliminate fraud by working with a partner who <a href=""https://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/04/prweb15434875.htm"">uses pre-bid anti-fraud controls</a> to block fraudulent users, sites and suspicious inventory. Also, ensure your partner has experts who can complete post-bid analysis and work to manually catch what algorithms can’t.

For example, our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/realvalue-advertising-platform/"">RealValue® Platform</a> has two industry-first algorithms that allow advertisers to algorithmically optimize their supply paths as well as root out and avoid fraudulent sites and users. With a full suite of pre- and post-bid technology that supports campaign success from beginning to end plus post-bid analysis reporting and analytics capabilities, our RealValue Platform can support complex optimizations, beyond what humans can achieve, and improve your average campaign lift 26% over control!
<h4>Go Direct</h4>
Our VP of enterprise partnerships Amanda Martin believes to be successful in our field, you have to understand the path a bid takes via an auction. It’s an important part of making informed decisions about ad buys. You need to value how much working media gets to the publisher and recognize who in the middle improves what you’re trying to buy and has supply path elements that benefit you and the client from a performance standpoint.
<ul>
 	<li>Digging in to understand those supply path elements and how they affect your campaign performance is a good plan of attack, but how do you go about it? Use ads.txt to your advantage. Ads.txt is an IAB-backed tool that places a text file on publishers’ web servers that lists all the companies authorized to sell a publisher’s inventory. This is a good starting point to ensure you're buying from approved SSPs and sellers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>You can also use ads.txt tools, such as Sellers.json and OpenRTB Supply Chain Object, that provide additional verification to fully understand who on the sell side are inventory direct sellers or resellers down to the bid request.</li>
</ul>
Working with publishers directly and with fewer suppliers can also help you avoid buying resold inventory, or the same site through multiple suppliers. As a bonus, this better protects you from unnecessary ad tech fees too.
<h4>Nurture Valuable Relationships</h4>
To be successful with SPO and improve the ad tech industry, our president Jay Friedman agrees you should first remove SSPs that aren’t making the cut:

“Everyone can shut off 60 of those 75 exchanges and not lose an ounce of scale,” Jay said. “If all major marketing companies or holding companies get on board, we can consolidate spend around the real exchanges and SSPs that deliver value.” He went on, “We want choice in the market, but we aren’t going to get rid of noise if we don’t consolidate.”

How do you consolidate and be selective about the SSPs you keep? Treat these valuable supplier relationships just as you would client relationships. Connect and collaborate with only a few SSPs for more transparency. Because you're working closely with a few hand-picked partners, you can feel comfortable asking your SSPs for log-level data to analyze bids and see the fees across the inventory you’re buying. This will help you understand how SSPs measure quality inventory and be sure it aligns with your goals. Another option is to determine the supply path strategy that shows the best performance for you and your clients and tailor your supply path strategy to that SSP/site combination. Lastly, remember to stay proactive. Continue to add and remove SSPs based on how their inventory performs.
<h4>Keep Innovating</h4>
With the industry always changing, learn the latest SPO techniques and experiment with them. Focus on volume control, programmatic-guaranteed structures and new products to stay one step ahead of ad fraud. Also, use your buying power to negotiate partnership terms, lower fees and better tools. For instance, <a href=""https://www.adexchanger.com/platforms/goodway-group-creates-its-own-low-fee-supply-path-to-pubmatic/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">we recently partnered with PubMatic</a> to foster SPO in the digital advertising industry. Jay said this about our industry-first partnership, “The level of effort required to be the first mover was pretty significant on both sides.” But he thinks this innovation and major effort were well worth it, especially if they convince more buyers across the industry to also consider consolidating spend with one of the top exchanges. “If one of the largest holding companies in the world does a deal like this, it will carry more industry weight and momentum, and all SSPs and exchanges will need to look at building something like this.”

<h3>What Are the Benefits of Supply Path Optimization?</h3>
This is the answer you’re probably most interested in. SPO efforts and hard work can lead to positive results that will ripple across your media campaigns and across the entire ad tech industry:
<h4>Benefit #1: The Ad Tech Industry Will Consolidate</h4>
Fewer industry players means you’ll pay a lower ad tech tax so more of your budget will go to working media. This will optimize your performance potential and boost your buying power. <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/how-advertisers-are-untangling-the-programmatic-supply-chain/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Adweek explains ad tech tax</a> is the part of your budget that advertising middlemen take for their services rather than direct premium publishers, and it estimates these middlemen take 60 cents of every programmatic dollar!
<h4>Benefit #2: The Ad Tech Industry Will Raise Its Standards</h4>
Behavior, transparency and inventory quality across the ad tech industry will improve. Media buyers will have more inventory control (know who is sourcing direct and indirect inventory) and can purchase inventory more efficiently and effectively.
<h4>Benefit #3: The Ad Tech Industry’s Programmatic Advertising Auctions Will Be Cleaner</h4>
Ad buying will become simpler and less redundant, with fewer bid requests and queries per second. Brand-safe inventory will be more available and ad fraud opportunities, such as domain spoofing (when a fraudster makes it appear they’re a premium publisher), will diminish.

1. Reach Current Visitors and Prospects With Your First-Party Data

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/people-based-marketing-grow-crm-data/"">First-party data</a> is a rich resource you should value above all other data. To take advantage of your first-party data, start by <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-people-based-marketing-works/"">segmenting interested prospects and past visitors</a> based on their individual motivations, interests and intentions. Create custom messaging and offers to appeal to each segment in your list. For instance, add exclusive new benefits to a premier sales package or subscription to make loyal customers want to claim VIP status. Or send a “Welcome Back! We’ve Missed You! Here’s What’s New!” message to those people on your list who visited during the past year but have not returned since.

Regularly target all different people on your list – prospects, visitors, loyal customers and super fans – by developing exclusive content made just for them, such as tailored quizzes and polls, challenges and contests, and special promotions and coupons. This will give you plenty of opportunities to connect with your audience in personal and engaging ways while helping you enhance your first-party data profiles too.

When tourists and locals are on the go and on their phones, reach them with mobile marketing. Use mobile geofencing to target tourists or locals based on their GPS coordinates, zip code, city, county or DMA. When your digital advertising appears on mobile sites or apps they’re viewing and they’re close by, they may be more apt to visit.

Or use mobile conquesting to target your competitors’ audiences. Consumers visiting a popular or competing attraction may make a special trip to stop off at your locale if they know about it. Another way to achieve good destination marketing results is to use mobile retargeting to advertise special promotions or discounts to those people who have visited your attraction in the past or already researched you online.

Parents? Kids? Teens? Sometimes, it’s hard to know who in the family will have the final say in the destination decision. Here’s how to get your brand and message out to every family member:

Reach parents with <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">behavioral targeting segments</a> or by advertising on parenting websites. To reach kids and teens, advertise across a range of children’s TV websites, YouTube channels, free music platforms or popular social networks. But be careful how you advertise to minors. Know what you can and can’t do according to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act [<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/complying-coppa-frequently-asked-questions"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">COPPA</a>]. (These rules prevent most forms of data collection on children younger than 13.)

To speak to everyone in the family at once, try household extension targeting, which lets you advertise simultaneously across all desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones in the same household.

4. Reach Ideal Customers With Search Campaigns

To get in front of ideal customers still out there, launch a destination marketing <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/do-not-google-own-keywords-sem-strategies/"">search campaign</a>. Consumers who are actively searching for similar destinations online, may reconsider their plans if your search ad pops up in time.

Targeting in-market searchers specifically with countdown ads can increase urgency and spur action. For instance, you can show searchers how many days are left before an exhibit closes or how much time is left before a promotion expires. To make the process easier, set up automatic advertising updates based on day or time.

Will they or won’t they? Sometimes, it’s a tossup. Prospects can be fickle. To make it more likely they WILL visit, put all the details they need to decide on a polished and easy-to-navigate website. Include videos, customer testimonials, thorough Q&amp;A, ticket prices and packages, coupon codes, hours, parking, driving directions, etc. Then people know what to expect before they choose to make the journey.

As the global economy and companies with supply chain links to Asian markets are already feeling the effects of the coronavirus crisis, the United States is bracing and preparing for the still to-be-seen impact here. U.S. officials at the federal, state and local levels are now contemplating how the virus could change daily life and creating contingency plans in case more extreme precautions like temporary business and school closures are advised. Are you curious how smart marketers are currently planning to face and overcome coronavirus and its digital media impact? Here are three ways you can prepare now:

1. Seize the Opportunity to Connect With Customers

Think strategically about when, where and how to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-step-holistic-marketing-formula"">reach your audience</a> in new or sophisticated ways via <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/media/"">digital platforms</a>.

Continuing to engage with U.S. consumers in an online environment, regardless of whether they are affected by the virus threat or not, is in the best interest of marketers. Because as long as the internet is still accessible and ad-supported, you can reach consumers and expect digital to drive measurable results to the bottom line. In fact, <a href=""https://www.asicentral.com/html/open/ProductsAndServices/supp/pdfs/Advertising_in_a_recession.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">a number of studies over many years</a> have shown those who advertise during economic downturns and times of crisis can actually increase market share when the right approach is taken.

One company taking the right approach? WeChat messaging app. According to the South China Morning Post, WeChat increased its user base by 115% year-over-year by giving housebound users in China a way to buy groceries directly through the app.

2. Keep Paid Digital Media Spends Holding Steady

While companies like Apple, Amazon, Hilton and many more are reporting projected losses for the first quarter of the year, it doesn’t seem to have affected overall paid media spends at this point, even as some companies shift advertising strategies, <a href=""https://www.wsj.com/articles/out-of-stock-coronavirus-in-china-threatens-amazon-sellers-11582713005"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">based upon product availability</a>. Goodway's U.S.-based advertisers have not pulled back on paid digital media spends due to virus fears, and there have been minimal strategic changes to campaigns due to product or service impacts at this time.

No matter the circumstances, stay the course and keep paid digital media spends in place to successfully confront coronavirus and its digital media impact. Daily life has a way of marching on, and when consumers are looking to buy what they need and want, you can be there with the right message at the right time. The competitive playing field also tends to be less crowded in uncertain times, which can work in your favor: You can get your message out and amplify it more easily and inexpensively to further build brand awareness and grow market share.

With the coronavirus outbreak and containment efforts happening in China now, people have fewer places to go and less to do outside the home. But the gloomy situation is rosy for marketers wanting an audience: Per eMarketer, <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/coronavirus-china-us-covid-19-impact-retail-travel"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">time spent with mobile internet and TV has recently grown</a> in that country since more people are stuck inside and turning to entertainment to ease boredom. Perhaps, this is the right time to experiment, test and invest in connected TV, search or social strategies. Though, before you do, know your brand’s value proposition and your audience so your message will resonate well. (In <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/us-consumers-tolerate-ads-if-theyre-expecting-them-or-theyre-incentivized"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">recent reports</a>, 56% of consumers said relevant ads didn’t bother them.)

With coronavirus casting a shadow, it may be tempting to step back and take a wait-and-see approach during this crisis. But facing coronavirus and its digital media impact head-on by doing the opposite can pay off in both the short and long term.

1. Go Beyond TV With Pre-Roll

Repurpose your traditional :30 TV spots and turn them into :15 pre-roll videos. Think of this digital video format as compelling mini TV commercials viewers must watch before their desired content, such as a YouTube video, loads.

How can you make your own :15 pre-roll videos user-friendly, memorable and engaging? Keep them brief, simple and clear. Include a voiceover and a strong call-to-action to keep viewers wanting to watch, and wanting to share. Don’t forget to design a polished post-click landing page to effectively capture your leads.

Automate your pharmaceutical advertising campaigns with trigger marketing. Whenever your audience takes a specific action – spends a certain amount of time on a website, signs up for a newsletter, downloads an app and such – be right there with pre-planned automated personalized messages, ready  to connect one-on-one with any potential customer at the perfect time.

Or counteract your competitor’s TV commercial by going digital. Set up digital ads with special offers and coupons to run across your prospects’ range of devices at the same time your competitor’s commercial airs to get all eyes on you and to maximize your brand presence.

3. Boost Your Brand With Cross-Device Targeting

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

Reach your audience across all their devices – phones, desktops, laptops, tablets, even gaming consoles and connected TV – with unified and personalized pharmaceutical advertising that appears in the right place, at the right time and at the right frequency. Cross-device targeting can help you analyze and map the ideal customer journey: spot patterns, learn which ads perform well (and on what devices and browsing environments) and get credit for all the conversions you drive.

Cross-device targeting helps marketers see the big picture and know just how they’re doing. “With cross-device technology, marketers no longer miss a specific target audience or their activities on particular marketing channels,” our president Jay Friedman said. “The cross-device methodology allows marketers to cover all their targeting bases, while attributing both behavioral impressions and conversions.”

5. Find Your Ideal Customers With HIPAA-Compliant Audience Targeting

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

Due to HIPAA and patient privacy concerns, targeting prospects and their caregivers is tricky: You have to target generally, not based on specific ailments or conditions. But smart <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">audience targeting</a> tactics can still help you segment your audience and reach everyone with relevant messages to great result.

Use behavioral targeting to reach people based on their past web behavior: what sites they’ve frequented, what pages they’ve viewed, what purchases they’ve made, and so on. Or try real-time category contextual targeting and keyword contextual targeting so your pharmaceutical advertising appears when prospects are searching for topics and keywords that match up with what you offer. This no-waste targeting can save you time and money and increase your campaign ROI since you are only talking to interested people.

Lastly, use search retargeting to build brand awareness and engagement. If your prospects searched the web for keywords related to what you offer over the past few days but haven’t visited your site, you can use search retargeting to advertise to them days later across the web in hopes of gaining their attention and winning their business.

The first thing you should do is believe working remotely is a valid way to work and embrace it. Don’t treat employees working remotely any differently than you would if they were in a centralized setting. Develop and practice cultural norms. For example, here at Goodway, we share a weekly internal blog with all employees to focus on our shared values. Also, be sure to reach out and talk with your employees often. Taking time to send a virtual hello will go a long way to making everyone feel cared for, noticed and appreciated.

Of course, working remotely is not a perfect science – there’s no right or wrong way to go about it. So, expect a few bumps and ups and downs as you find your way and evolve.

Nurture and Support Your Employees

Support your team by helping them shift their mindsets to embrace virtual work practices. Establish firm rules of conduct, such as office hours and work space expectations, and be available. Do what you say you’re going to do to build trust with your team and be as open and transparent as possible. Share your work calendar (and include personal tasks on it as well) so your team knows when they can reach you if the need arises.

Use technology to communicate well and regularly: When you do, adjust how you communicate, coach and support your employees. Lead them based on their distinct personalities and needs. For instance, set up weekly check-ins or have stand-up meetings so you can better get to know them, track their progress and provide <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/agencies/how-flexible-work-environments-can-help-women-advance-in-their-careers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">opportunities for professional growth</a>.

Above all, remember to be flexible; focus on employees’ achievements, not on the hours worked. And always be looking for new ways to gauge success and celebrate wins.

Find Effective Virtual Tools

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

Finding the right online tools that mirror a live office experience is crucial to how your remote workforce operates day to day. Choose a good social chat system (we like Microsoft Teams) so employees have a way to instantly connect, communicate and share. And look for tools that offer features, such as whiteboarding, virtual sticky notes and polls.

Keep all your online work tools in one place so they’re easy to find by using a single sign-on (SSO) software (we use Okta). And document everything. Record meetings, strategy sessions, industry discussions, best practices and more and build out an internal searchable wiki (such as Confluence) to house this knowledge so employees can access any info they need at any time. Get an effective file-sharing system too, preferably a shared drive (check out Egnyte) so you have a place to store, organize and work on project files in real time. Another tip? Tag employees with the @ symbol on documents, emails and chats to help them keep track of projects and to-dos.

Embracing virtual tools like these can only make your organization stronger and more organized over time, no matter if you continue working remotely or return to your routine work environment.

Keep Connecting and Collaborating

Love the camera: For conference calls, consider investing in robust video conferencing software (Zoom is good!). Requiring face-to-face interaction not only helps your calls feel more like regular in-office meetings but also minimizes multitasking.

Make team bonding a priority so your employees can continue connecting and collaborating well. Keep up a little small talk before you get down to business. This goes a long way to building relationships, making authentic connections, strengthening teams and increasing productivity when working remotely. And don’t forget the fun – try a quick ice breaker at the start of a video call or reserve an hour each month for your team to hop on a video call to do a fun activity, play a game or have a nice chat during happy hour.

Beyond immediate team bonding, give employees virtual opportunities to get to know others throughout your organization. Keep them connected by hosting virtual events and building virtual communities and pods. For instance, offer a range of virtual groups employees can join, such as health, wellness and life hack groups, book clubs and more.

Be sure to get employees together regularly in person too. At Goodway, we bring together local groups occasionally for lunch and coworking. And twice a year, our whole company gathers in one place for a full week of meetings, activities and fun. In fact, each all-company trip always feels like a huge celebration, or like a big family reunion with our extended work family. So much so, it’s not uncommon for employees to take their own vacation time to fly in the weekend before and meet up with colleagues from around the country for shared fun.

Encourage Work/Life Balance

When working remotely, do your best to help employees achieve work/life balance. Encourage employees to set boundaries around their work and trust they will get the job done without a lot of heavy monitoring. Offering a little flexibility and autonomy are keys to keeping morale high.

Also, remind employees they can step away from their desks regularly – to stretch, go to lunch, take a break or knock out a quick errand or task they normally wouldn’t be able to tackle in a regular office environment. That way, they stay happy, healthy and productive. And when distractions – kids, pets or visitors – happen (which they will!), remember we’re only human and give yourself and your employees grace.

The couch is comfortable when you want to relax. But a  separate work space, or ideally a room of your own, will make you more productive. Get a desk, a nice keyboard and mouse and invest in a good webcam and an earpiece to keep echoes at bay. Consider an external monitor, noise-cancelling headphones and an ergonomic desk chair (or even a <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Posture-Corrector-Men-Women-Truweo/dp/B07DKHTKP3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">posture corrector</a>). Your body will thank you. Then order all those addicting office supplies (you know you want to!): notebooks, Post-It Notes and so on, so you have everything you need to be effective.

Once you have to get serious and buckle down, treat the time you spend in your home office as working time. Act as you would in a traditional office environment; avoid distractions. One tip? Create the right signals. For instance, put a sign outside your office door so your family knows when you can and can’t be disturbed.

But remember to have a little fun too. Embrace what you normally can’t do when you’re in a regular office: light candles, throw an afternoon dance party or destress for a few minutes and play with your pet or visit with your family.

Pajamas, slippers and a baseball cap may be your uniform of choice, but look professional when it matters. Set up video calls as much as possible. You can gain a lot from and contribute much more to a conversation face-to-face. Seeing and talking with everyone is a good way to have more social interaction (and kick loneliness to the curb), improve communication and deepen relationships. And you won’t be tempted to multitask.

Make your calendar visible and stay on your colleagues’ radar. In a remote work environment, it’s important to overcommunicate and inject all you write and say with more personality than you normally would so people can truly “see” you. Send and quickly reply to emails and participate as much as possible during meetings. Keep a to-do list and share it regularly with your team so they always know what you’re working on, and your progress. And be sure to set your work hours and tell your team. Having a set start time and end time can help you draw boundaries around your workday. Then once the day is through, mentally leave work behind, either by putting your laptop away or simply shutting your office door.

When you want to stop procrastinating and get more done, remember to<a href=""https://clockify.me/blog/productivity/eat-frog-technique/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""> eat the big frog first</a>. Tell yourself to try a dreaded task for just 5 or 10 minutes. You’ll probably  discover the hard part was simply starting, and you’ll more than likely push through until it’s done.

Are you an extrovert who likes to talk on the phone? An introvert who shudders at the thought and would rather a billion pings from messaging software? Tell your coworkers how you like to communicate and keep in close contact with them. And when cabin fever hits, stave it off, if possible, by working elsewhere – at a coffee shop or at a coworking space from time to time. A change in scenery may be all it takes to stoke your creativity and rev up your productivity.

Also, focus on team bonding to build comfort and trust. Our best advice? Take an hour or so each month to hop on a call and have a good time together as a team, without any thought of work. Play games (we like Drawsaurus, Family Feud and Kahoot!, to name a few), try some ice breakers or simply <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2020/03/15/815973389/virtual-happy-hour-anyone-working-from-home-but-keeping-connected"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">enjoy a virtual happy hour</a>, whatever it takes to find the fun!

Weave together your personal responsibilities  and your work obligations. Color-code your work and personal tasks on your calendar and sync it to your phone so you know at a glance what needs to get done. Block off time for lunch and breaks to <a href=""https://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/the-pomodoro-technique-is-it-right-for-you.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">stay sharp and productive</a>. Need ideas for your downtime? Step back from your screens and rest your eyes. Cook. Knock out some housework while listening to your music playlist or audiobook. Exercise or catch up with family and friends. If work still calls, hop back on later to wrap up projects or knock out email.

Due to widespread coronavirus concern and growing restrictions, normal everyday life has been put on pause for now. Consumers, no longer out and about, are avoiding all but the most essential store runs in an effort to stay healthy. Instead, they’re turning to e-commerce to get what they need shipped right to their door. They’re also turning to digital devices, both mobile and desktop, to connect with others despite the required self-isolation and social-distancing policies. Be it to stay entertained or to get educated on the latest developments, they are logging in to social networks, smart TVs, video game consoles, and their phones more than ever before.

With variances in consumer behavior comes shifts in media consumption, and <a href=""https://www.adexchanger.com/advertiser/quarantined-how-the-coronavirus-shutdowns-impact-marketers/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">digital advertisers are adapting quickly</a>. For example, some advertisers have already taken precautionary measures when it comes to their media including <a href=""https://www.adweek.com/digital/can-the-coronavirus-crisis-prompt-a-correction-in-brand-safety-tactics/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">implementing blacklists and increasing negative keyword lists</a>.

Digital advertisers are also scaling up spend in channels that align with consumer behavior shifts and cutting costs in channels that don’t. Since sporting events have been postponed or cancelled and once bustling cities have grown quiet for now, smart advertisers are looking for ways to move traditional TV, print and outdoor spend to advanced TV or connected TV.

Ad messaging is also shifting during this difficult time. Some advertisers are replacing their usual come visit/shop/purchase/dine/join messaging with health-focused or PSA-style ads, while others are pausing promotional campaigns to refocus on their evergreen branding.

<a href=""https://marketingland.com/coronavirus-creating-disruption-uncertainty-for-digital-marketing-ecosystem-277194"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">What does the future hold</a>? Advertisers will lean more and more on digital alternatives to offset in-person event cancellations (think video conferencing and virtual events), which will magnify the need for 5G wireless technology. They will also start focusing on high-traffic channels, such as Amazon, paid search and social to follow consumer news and shopping trends. And as advertisers become more cautious about where their ads are running and shy away from keywords that may have a negative brand impact, contextual targeting strategies will likely become more popular.

The way ad campaigns are measured may even change too. To adapt to the current market, advertisers may choose to look at longer lifetime value or profitability metrics rather than cost per action (CPA) or return on ad spending (ROAS).

What marketing strategies should you activate now? During the COVID-19 pandemic, can your brand serve customers and prospects well? For example, Peloton's workout-from-home business model fits perfectly into the rising need for social distancing. Or can your brand step in and fill a crucial public service gap? If so, before launching any service-oriented digital ad campaigns like these, make sure your messaging is mindful and socially responsible. Test the campaigns first before rolling them out widely to be sure they don’t negatively affect your brand image or sales.

Make emotional connections with your customers while they’re in COVID-19 crisis mode. Consumers will always remember how a brand makes them feel. And a consumer’s emotional connection to a brand will power brand loyalty and longer customer lifetime value. If you’re not doing this already, pivot to meet customers’ and prospects’ current and ever-changing needs. For example, if you’re a grocery chain, promote delivery services. If you’re a gym, move to virtual trainings. Or if you’re a restaurant, focus on takeout and contactless pickup or delivery options. Keep looking for ways to stay in the game. Providing products and services at a social distance is the new table stakes for business.

Look at messaging receiving positive traction within your website, organic and paid media, and especially social channels. Now is the time to focus on the voice of the customer: Read customer comments, emails or chat. If you’re not getting enough customer interaction through marketing channels, tap into your call center, sales or customer service teams. Monitor calls. You’ll be amazed at what you can learn by just listening for trends. Are you seeing shifts in purchasing behavior across your revenue channels? Shift to align with where you're seeing positive results. For example, if you're seeing a shift from retail to online purchase, revise your strategy to increase messaging that focuses on online calls to action. Or start creating positive results. On the other hand, be sure to play good defense with any challenges or problems that crop up. For instance, if you’re an e-commerce retailer and shipping is delayed, be proactive and tell your customers, maybe with a huge banner on your site. Create the right organic or paid messaging strategy to communicate well with your audience while staying true to your brand’s core values.

Each market is operating in a different reality right now. Make sure you're evaluating market-level performance and optimizing your advertising strategy within each. Analyze where and how your audience is now spending their time. Once you understand where these shifts are happening, you can uncover opportunities to continue to engage your target consumers well. Also, decide whether to focus on acquisition or retention. Is it still profitable to acquire new customers? How are you going about retaining current customers? Developing specific messaging to attain new customers and retain your current client base is equally important.

Watching the restaurant industry fall on hard times due to the pandemic is hard to come to grips with considering a few short weeks ago, the $899B industry contributed 4% to the United States’ GDP. Consumers typically spent close to 50% of their monthly food budget on dining out until COVID-19 forced them to break the habit. With the U.S. government’s shelter in place restrictions now in effect, consumer behavior has had to change seemingly overnight. In fact, in just three short weeks, nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults have decreased how often they eat out as a result of COVID-19.

And restaurant workers and their families have absorbed some hard blows: In fact, research firm, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas reported over 600 food service industry jobs were cut due to the pandemic, and 7.4M jobs in the sector could soon be cut or impacted severely.

How the Restaurant Industry Continues to Serve Their Customers

Fast, casual and fine dining restaurants everywhere are quickly rallying now with a fighting spirit in the wake of COVID-19 – fully shifting their businesses to accommodate takeout and delivery. Some establishments have turned to food delivery services like Caviar, DoorDash and Seamless to help meet current consumer demand. Yet the trades are predicting this trend will steadily decline too, as individuals become more wary of food handling risks in the midst of a pandemic. “There’s no making money right now,” says Ben Walker, VP of sales and marketing at Baldor Specialty Foods. “It’s redefining our role to keep the food supply running – from farmer to consumer.”

Wholesale suppliers and restaurants are indeed redefining their role right now, and doing so on the fly. Food supply wholesalers, who typically serve restaurants and schools, have pivoted to selling essential items to consumers now that some grocery store shelves stand empty. And restaurants are taking care of their own and their customers, providing meals for their employees and families and selling chilled ready-made meals, fruits, vegetables and other provisions, such as cleaning products and toilet paper.

What should you be doing now to best support your restaurant brand and fortify it for the future? Our digital advertising experts recommend marketers focus on these three areas:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Be Timely and Responsive</strong>: If you change your restaurant services, menus or hours, keep your customers informed. Update your website, social media and directories. (Surprisingly, many restaurants haven’t done this yet.) Ensure your phone lines can handle high-volume calls and quickly train your staff to seamlessly carry out new processes to keep your customers happy and satisfied. <a href=""https://www.qsrweb.com/articles/is-your-restaurant-speaking-the-covid-19-era-customers-language/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Now’s the time to innovate</a>. Meet and serve your customers and communities where they are now. Consider offering free meals to essential workers and first responders, special meal deals to go, “assemble at home” meal kits or gift cards at a discount – whatever you can do to lend a hand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Prioritize Health and Safety</strong>: Establish safety measures and mention them at the forefront of your marketing efforts to ease customers’ fears. Service-minded messages, such as curbside pickup, contactless delivery or pay as you can, can go a long way in creating customers for life once the lockdown ends and the restaurant industry rebounds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Focus on Your First-Party Data</strong>: Gather and organize <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">the data you own</a> and examine it carefully to glean new insights. Find out who your best customers are and then connect with them regularly. Model new audiences from <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-party-data-targeting/"">your own customer data</a> to extend your reach for the biggest gain.</li>
</ul>

Bags packed and ready to travel, someday. But for now, with coronavirus (COVID-19) sweeping the country and strict shelter-in-place restrictions in effect, people on the move have had to stay in and embrace being homebodies. Here’s a look at how COVID-19 is affecting travel and tourism today and the three areas travel industry marketers can work on now to positively impact results later.

COVID-19 has not only threatened our health but also the health of the travel and tourism industry. In fact, <a href=""https://today.yougov.com/topics/economist/survey-results"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">more than 50% of U.S. adults have canceled travel plans</a> for the next few months in response to COVID-19. With these travel plans either postponed or canceled, the entire industry – from hotels to airlines to tourist attractions – has had to pay a high price. In its <a href=""https://www.ustravel.org/sites/default/files/media_root/document/Coronavirus_2020_Impacts_WEB.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">“The Economic Impact of the Coronavirus Due to Travel Losses,”</a> Oxford Economics estimates this high price at a $355B deficit, forcing marketers to completely shift priorities on their marketing road map.

Bookings at hotels and airlines are down and decreasing, but history tells us this is likely temporary. During the 2008-2009 great recession, certain public travel companies were trading at all-time lows. But coming out of that period, according to <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Yahoo Finance</a>, those same companies saw rebounds of 500% within six months. Though COVID-19 is a health crisis, not an economic one, consumer behavior will still likely follow this pattern once we get a handle on this virus: after a big decrease, a big rebound.

To start planning and laying your brand’s groundwork today for the greatest impact tomorrow, here are our digital advertising pros’ top tips:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Practice Good Customer Data Hygiene</strong>: Sort out all the customer data you own. Organize and strategize how to best use it now. Then model audiences to gain insight into your customers’ highest lifetime value. This will give you a strong point of view on who to reach first once the travel and tourism industry can resume normal marketing efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Find the Human Connections</strong>: People remember how brands make them feel. Take the time to study and understand the emotional connections you already have with your customers. From these insights, redefine your current marketing communication and advertising efforts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Develop a Smart Re-engagement Strategy</strong>: According to eMarketer, 47% of travelers with canceled trips plan to rebook domestically. As important as it is to find net-new customers, the first step is to <a href=""https://issuu.com/goodwaygroup7/docs/201702-11024?e=30752874/57056622"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">go after those people who are already in-market</a>. Start collecting data on those individuals who have canceled or postponed their trips.

Theme parks are usually the happiest places on earth. Now that happiness has been put on hold. In the last several weeks, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has forced U.S. theme park giants to shut their gates, suspend operations and pause construction on all new rides and attractions. But operators are working diligently during this downtime to figure out just how to reopen safely, and what safety and wellness measures to take when they do. Read on to understand how COVID-19 is impacting theme parks today and five ways theme park marketers can plan now to reach customers and new audiences in the future.

The biggest question on theme park marketers’ minds amid the pandemic must be, What are people thinking? To find out, Performance Research, a leading sports and event research and consulting firm, decided to team up with national online sampling partner Full Circle Research Co. on the <a href=""http://performanceresearch.com/covid-19-is-ratcheting-up-consumer-anxiety-about-future-events-but-there-are-silver-linings-for-the-sports-and-entertainment-industry/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Impact of COVID-19 on Live Events Study</a>. When they asked consumers what would be top of mind for them when returning to events, here’s what they found:

Venue cleanliness and sanitation as well as general health safety made the top of the list. So what hygiene precautions are theme park operators considering before welcoming guests again? Checking temperatures before allowing guests to enter the park and ensuring social distancing while guests wait in line for rides are two. ""One of the things that we’re discussing already is that in order to return to some semblance of normal, people will have to feel comfortable that they’re safe,"" said Disney’s Executive Chairman, Bob Iger. ""Just as we now do bag checks for everybody that goes into our parks, it could be that at some point we add a component of that that takes people’s temperatures, as a for-instance.”

Jed Pearsall, founder of Performance Research, said, “The results of this study, conducted in what may be the height of anxiety regarding the pandemic, show that eventgoers will come back, albeit with reservations and a limited sense of urgency, “ he said. “When considering all the barriers to event attendance, perhaps nothing can be more personal and emotional than health and safety.""

Six Flags also did a little recent research of its own. It sent a <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/six-flags-customer-survey-reveals-potential-responses-to-coronavirus-2020-3"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">survey</a> to its customers asking what their COVID-19 concerns were and how they thought Six Flags should respond to the pandemic. This was a natural approach for the theme park. In a statement provided to Business Insider on the survey, Six Flags shared, ""We are a guest-focused company. The opinions and sentiments of our guests matter greatly to us.”

Since the theme park industry is dealing with a slew of unknowns due to COVID-19, it’s easy to see how you could get stuck in the now. But here are five ways you can start planning for how to connect with customers and new audiences in the future:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Ensure actions speak louder than words</strong>. Put health-related precautions in place to make your guests feel safe. Build a go-to-market strategy that will showcase your careful planning and all the work you’ve done to ensure guest wellness and safety. Reach out to the right customers and prospects and work at building emotional connections over achieving better campaign performance or more sales. When life returns to normal, people will remember how brands made them feel during a time of crisis.</li>
 	<li><strong>Show less is more</strong>. Once the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has deemed theme parks safe again, customers will still be trepidatious about gathering in large groups. Ease their anxiety by simplifying online offerings and streamlining the digital user experience, which can both help reduce confusion and online bounce rates as users weigh their options.</li>
 	<li><strong>Rely on contactless communication</strong>. In the new era of social distancing, get mobile technology on your side. Enhance your mobile in-app experience so your customers can make purchases, receive alerts, get real-time notifications, access park maps and more. Consider even letting guests scan their phone to enter the park.</li>
 	<li><strong>Change strategy</strong>. With TV upfronts delayed, sports canceled and a recession looming, ensure your marketing strategy is precise. Understand consumer sentiment shifts, spending habits and media consumption to make every dollar count. This knowledge can help you reach the right audiences with the right messages. And to guide people back to your brand and to your park, be flexible and willing to change your strategy often to keep up with changing consumer behavior.</li>
 	<li><strong>Make first-party data your first priority</strong>. Evaluate and update your first-party data. Break down any data siloes. Consolidate your customer data so it’s insightful, actionable and measurable. Be sure to model audiences and gain insight into your highest lifetime value customers to get a strong indication of just whom to reach when your park can reopen.</li>
</ol>

When the coronavirus (COVID-19) first swept through the United States, having to shelter in place to stop the spread didn’t seem so bad. Being isolated at home for a bit sounded peaceful, cozy even. But now that you’ve binged-watched Netflix until you can binge no more, gotten over the joy of placing that last jigsaw in your 1,000-piece puzzle and lost your drive to win family game nights, what do you do next? How do you move forward when home sweet home has gone stale, you long to see new faces and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">flattening the curve</a> is crushing your social spirit? We know it’s hard to be away from family, friends and even coworkers right now. To show our support and help you avoid the mental and physical effects social isolation can cause, check out these 9 ways to connect while apart during COVID-19:

1.       <strong>Get active and outside.</strong> Commune with nature, if possible. Wander through your neighborhood, go on a walk or a run with a friend (but keep your distance to at least 6 feet apart) or enjoy a city stroll and watch how a little exercise and sunshine can help you <a href=""https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/outdoor-exercise-benefits.aspx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">kick stress to the curb</a>.

2.       <strong>Find inner peace.</strong> No matter how chaotic the world is around you, meditate regularly to quiet your mind. Start where you are and with what you have. There’s no right or wrong way to go about it; you can only gain wonderful benefits. According to Healthline, <a href=""https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/12-benefits-of-meditation"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">meditation can improve anxiety, stress, memory, focus and more</a>.

3.       <strong>Give thanks.</strong> It’s hard to adjust to the new normal when you wistfully want the old normal back. But to adapt and benefit, <a href=""https://www.happierhuman.com/benefits-of-gratitude/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">focus on being grateful</a> for what you have. Try writing in a <a href=""https://my.happify.com/hd/why-you-should-write-a-gratitude-journal/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">gratitude journal</a> at least a few days a week. Or before you drift off to sleep each night, think of three things you’re grateful for each day. This can help shift your mindset from doom and gloom to shiny and happy. Another option is to remember all the beauty life still has to offer. Check out these <a href=""http://1000awesomethings.com/the-top-1000/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">1000 awesome things</a> like #995 Finding Money You Didn’t Know You Lost, #973 Sleeping in New Bed Sheets and #947 Neighbors With Pools. Not into listicles? That’s OK; you can <a href=""http://1000awesomethings.com/ted-talks/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">watch TED talks on the topic</a> to reclaim joy in your preferred medium.

4.       <strong>Encourage communication.</strong> Go high tech and embrace video calls by getting your family and friends up to speed on all the latest technologies. Check out free apps that can pull you together, such as <a href=""https://hangouts.google.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Google Hangouts</a>, <a href=""https://www.skype.com/en/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Skype</a>, <a href=""https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204380"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">FaceTime</a> and <a href=""https://www.whatsapp.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">WhatsApp</a>. Or if being in front of the camera isn’t your idea of fun, call or text someone you adore for a chat. Any contact or connection is good for the soul.

5.       <strong>Be social.</strong> If you’re all dressed up with nowhere to go, here are some ideas to mentally go places when you have to stay at home but are climbing the walls. With so many virtual experiences available during lockdown, your social calendar will fill up quickly. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdmPjhKMaXNNeCr1FjuMvag"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Go to the theatre</a>, <a href=""https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2020/04/02/these-museums-are-offering-free-virtual-tours/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">wander through a museum</a>, <a href=""https://www.scribendi.com/advice/online_book_clubs.en.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">join a book club</a>, <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90478307/stuck-at-home-take-free-drawing-classes-from-famous-illustrators"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">take an art class</a> or even <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogersands/2020/03/19/a-virtual-comedic-experience-streaming-the-jokes-to-you/#1d4bd3bc71ca"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">hit a comedy club – all without ever leaving your house</a>!

The choices are endless now, and jumping into virtual activities is a great way to interact with others, reduce anxiety, find your flow and still feel out and about while doing what’s best right now, staying home to keep you and everyone safe.

6.    <strong>Be a helper.</strong> <a href=""https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/between-cultures/201805/in-helping-others-you-help-yourself"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Doing good not only helps others but helps yourself.</a> When you feel bad, get a quick mood boost by doing nice things for others. For example, smile and interact with people you meet (from afar) when you go for your daily walk. Or consider picking up groceries for elderly neighbors, donating to food banks or paying it forward when you hit the drive-thru. Being a helper actually helps you find meaning, purpose and better well-being.

7.    <strong>Get together.</strong> Go beyond an occasional virtual happy hour and create an online social or work group. Host a video lunch to feel like you’re eating or chatting together, almost like normal. Or think about hosting a video call with family, friends or colleagues to relax, unwind and enjoy some fun and games.

Try playing <a href=""https://www.jackboxgames.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Jackbox Games</a> online during a video call. Our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/what-makes-us-different/"">Goodway</a> marketing team recently tried this for a little team bonding. It went quite smoothly over <a href=""https://zoom.us/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Zoom</a> and was a real hit with the whole team! Looking for something more interactive and techy? Check out <a href=""https://www.airconsole.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">AirConsole</a> to play quick video games, using your phone as your gamepad.

8.       <strong>Become whom you want to be.</strong> You have the power to turn into a person you don’t even recognize once the pandemic is over. How about a Spanish-speaking, banjo-playing, speed-reading magician? Go for it! Now’s the time to gain some new knowledge and pick up all the hobbies you never had time for before.

Or get a free education on most anything you want to learn on YouTube. Give a new language a go with <a href=""https://www.duolingo.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Duolingo</a>.

Or go the Ivy League route, with these <a href=""https://www.edx.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">free courses</a>.

If all else fails and you’re STILL BORED, press the <a href=""https://www.boredbutton.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">bored button</a>. When you do, you’ll be whisked off to one of hundreds of websites, specifically chosen to NOT bore you to tears!

9.       <strong>Find the humor.</strong> If you’re in a funk or forget what it feels like to laugh, get doses of good medicine by watching these funny sketches across the internet. <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@makeshift.macaroni/video/6811322581883440390"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hear a song you’ll want to play over and over</a> that hilariously explains the pains of online teaching and learning.

Social distancing mandates have made it difficult for your audience to come to you, but you can still bring your products or services to them. If you’re a gym, turn your in-person fitness classes into virtual ones to satisfy customers and potentially attract a wider audience. If you’re a restaurant or retail shop, offer gift cards buyers can get now to treat themselves later once the COVID-19 threat has passed. This can help you get the sales you need now while giving customers something to look forward to in the future. Or offer curbside pickup and expanded free delivery to improve your customer experience.

Bookstores have gotten creative in how they connect with customers during the crisis. For instance, <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/usaandmain/2020/03/27/coronavirus-small-business-adapting/2910230001/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">{pages: a bookstore}</a> in L.A. moved their book clubs to Zoom.

Since many people are suffering financially, try deferring car payments or offering service discounts to properly care for your customers. And enable live chat on your website so you can engage eager prospects when they’re shopping from home and making vehicle comparisons and have questions.

<a href=""https://www.dallaszoo.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Zoos</a> and <a href=""https://www.childrensmuseum.org/museum-at-home"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">museums</a>, tourist attractions usually buzzing with crowds, have also gotten comfortable going virtual by offering virtual exhibit tours and themed activities on their websites and more. Even children’s party places have moved the typical weekend birthday circuit online. Princesses no longer have to princess-wave to kids in person. Now they can join a Zoom call and make a grand appearance at a <a href=""https://www.joysprincessparties.com/nyprincessparty.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">pixel dust party</a> instead!

No matter your small business, opportunities abound for reaching and engaging your audience in new ways in our new world. The only limit is your imagination.

With many people spending the bulk of their time at home these days, revisit your media strategy and consider shifting some of your media dollars to advanced TV or paid social media.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/advanced-tv-stat-pack-slides-direct-download"">Advanced TV</a>, which encompasses all types of non-traditional TV you can watch on a smart TV, your phone, your desktop or tablet, is seeing tremendous growth right now. In fact, <a href=""https://ir.roku.com/static-files/e7f56c0d-313e-4b32-83c0-3233f0b85017"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Roku</a> predicts roughly half of U.S. homes will cut their cable or satellite cords by 2024. But with everyone home and watching more streaming TV during the pandemic, this may happen sooner rather than later. Just how much more TV are people watching these days? <a href=""https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/17/nielsen-explains-how-covid-19-could-impact-media-usage-across-the-u-s/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Nielsen says it’s up nearly 60%</a>. Now’s the time to experiment with advanced TV: With more impressions available and less demand and less competition, try it, test it and experiment to see what it can do for your business. Want to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-questions-to-ask-before-buying-advanced-tv/"">get up to speed quickly on the topic</a>, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/advanced-tv-definitions-need-know/"">learn the lingo</a> and explore all the types and options?

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/does-paid-social-work"">Paid social media</a> is another digital advertising channel that’s become more popular with users looking to stay informed and entertained right now: In fact, <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/social-media-advertising-in-q2-2020-and-beyond"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a> reported Business Insider Intelligence found 50.8% of U.S. adults spent more time on social networks due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nearly half (49.7%) of those who were increasing their usage said they were spending 1 to 3 more hours per day while 17.9% said they were spending more than 3 additional hours:

Paid social media, like advanced TV, also has more impressions available now at <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/covid-19-programmatic-trends/"">reduced prices</a>. So if you incorporate it into your media strategy, your advertising budget will go farther, and you’ll have the potential to reach more prospects.

#3: Build Your Brand Message

According to a <a href=""https://adage.com/article/agency-news/kantar-study-shows-consumers-expect-brands-be-helpful-during-coronavirus-pandemic/2246361"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">recent Kantar study</a>, 77% of consumers who responded expect brands to be helpful during the coronavirus pandemic, and 75% of them felt that companies should not exploit the health crisis to promote their brand. Only 8% of respondents felt that companies should stop advertising completely. So what should you do and how should you communicate during this sensitive time to be thoughtful but stay top of mind?

Go with a caring “we’re all in this together” unity message over an offer-based message. This will better resonate with customers. Think through how you can genuinely connect with people now and how you can improve your customer experience and your community.

Create helpful online resources packed with information and advice your audience needs. Send regular emails too that not only include your business updates but also how you’re monitoring, responding and adapting to COVID-19 and doing all you can to keep everyone healthy and safe.

Make sure your website is up to date and user-friendly. Explain any business changes there and how you’re handling COVID-19.

Dial up your social presence as well by posting more frequently. When you post, try to capture the human element through engaging stories. Give your audience a glimpse behind the scenes of your business or spotlight employees. Be reachable and readily available on social media channels to quickly reply to questions. Another way to garner more notice for your brand? Find and partner with a social media influencer who is a good match for your business.

Also, update your search keywords to match changing consumer queries. For example, focus on rentals, deliveries or other newly popular terms. And keep an eye on what your competitors are doing. What stories are they telling? What are they promoting? What angle are they taking now? Doing this can help you brainstorm and come up with compelling content of your own.

What are your competitors up to? How are they faring? What’s happening in your industry? Here’s how to get the intel you need to succeed:

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/covid-19-resources"">Look at COVID-19-related updates, articles and research</a>. Check your competitors’ websites regularly and sign up for their newsletters. Use Moat to get the latest display creative and messaging. Or conduct a competitive website analysis with Alexa’s Site Comparisons or SimilarWeb. To review competitive ad spending, try Kantar and Nielsen Ad Intel.

Use free Google tools such as Google Search, Google Alerts, Google Trends and Think with Google to understand search activity. (Remember, though, while you’re searching, never Google your brand terms. This could negatively impact your search campaigns.) Or use additional free or paid search tools, such as SpyFu, SEMrush, The Search Monitor, SE Ranking, Moz Local and Serpstat to dig into competitors’ keyword lists and organic rankings. Another smart move? Ask your SEM analyst or partner to do this:

·       Pull a competitive benchmark to measure impression share.

·       Pull an auction insights report to understand competitors that are in the auction with you for the same types of keywords.

·       Use scripts to monitor auction insights.

Be sure to also check out your competitors’ social media presence. Manually search all the social platforms for content about them. Use Twitter’s advanced search function, follow or like competitors' pages and get paid ad insights via Twitter's Transparency Center or Facebook's Ad Library. To monitor organic social, share of voice (SOV) and engagement, use Rival IQ.

One common conquesting strategy everyone knows is to bid on closing competitors’ content to garner their impression share and win at the brand level. But to truly get a step ahead and keep your competitors’ conquesting efforts at bay, run evergreen and brand campaigns and pivot your messaging and measurement strategy across prime digital channels. Create an <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/media/"">omnichannel digital advertising plan</a> to find your desired audience at the right moments to win impressions, gain favor with consumers and build your market share. Before you set up your conquesting efforts across media tactics, consider these channel best practices:

<strong>Search</strong>

·       Create ad groups with the competitive keywords for each brand you identified to target.

·       Build out your conquesting campaigns by match type at the campaign level using Exact Match and Broad Match Modifier (BMM).

·       Negative Match the Exact Match keywords against the BMM campaign.

·       Start with modest bids and small budgets, with more budget for Exact Match. But note: Your cost per click (CPC) will likely be high and impression share limited because your competitive conquesting keywords have lower quality scores for non-brand owners.

·       Ensure your ad copy text doesn’t use a competitor’s name, though you can include it in a display URL.

·       Avoid Dynamic Keyword Insertion (DKI).

<strong>Social</strong>

·       Take advantage of your social platform’s targeting capabilities, including brand-type interest and competitive brand name interests/following audience groups.

·       Tap into purchase behaviors and detailed competitive segments using our partnership with Oracle and import them into Facebook for targeting.

·       Target similar or competitors’ brand apps with our access to app-based audiences.

·       Consider using awareness campaigns to deliver ads and optimize toward ad recall lift.

·       Use reach and frequency objective to daypart ad serving and regulate high-intent times based on competitive engagement research.

·       Make automatic or manual bid adjustments to ensure competitive impression share.

<strong>Programmatic</strong>

·       Establish audience segments based on brand interest, intent or affinity toward competitors’ brands.

·       Target keywords found in URL strings to purchase a unique brand, product or category and layer them on top of shopping reviews or vertical targeting to align with your identified competitors.

·       Reach frequent purchasers and those loyal to your brand through app ownership audiences.

·       Uncover real-world behavioral data by creating proximity retargeting to target users by previous in-store visitation and frequency.

·       Provide an opportunity for in-store comparison shopping by <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/multi-location/"">creating geofences</a> surrounding competitors’ physical store locations.

·       Get the same level of targeting options as programmatic and extend your reach to household level with <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/advanced-tv-bother-guide/"">advanced TV</a>.

·       Discover which broadcast channels your competitors are buying the most media from and average frequency and heavy up hours of ad exposure leading to in-store visits.

·       Organize audiences based on ad exposure and layer that with recency to deliver messaging that closely aligns with what competitors are saying.

Step 3: Fine-Tune Your Messaging

Your messaging matters most in a time of crisis. While your media strategy should center around competitive conquesting efforts, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-people-based-marketing-works/"">your messaging strategy should center on creating an emotional connection</a> with consumers. To show empathy and provide support while keeping your brand top of mind, polish your messaging like this:

·       <strong>Evaluate current competitive messaging</strong>. Do your homework and understand your competitors’ current (and past) focus. Determine what distinct advantage you have over them and communicate that appropriately and effectively.

·       <strong>Know what consumers are saying</strong>. Discover what consumers think about your competitors and your brand. For example, if you read significant content about the poor customer service your competitor is providing, tailor your own messaging to address this issue.

·       <strong>Find the right story and tone</strong>. Ensure your messaging fits within each media environment to appeal to and interest consumers. Although you want to take advantage of competitors’ closures and win over abandoned customers, maintain your brand authenticity and purpose through it all.

·       <strong>Establish a human connection</strong>. Power brand loyalty and longer customer lifetime value by understanding the emotional connection you currently have with your customers and displaying it to potential customers.

·       <strong>Act and do before telling</strong>. Plan and implement proper health-related precautions to make customers feel safe and secure. Then build a messaging strategy showcasing all the careful planning you’ve done and continue to do behind the scenes to ensure consumer wellness and safety.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) news is dominating social feeds and generating a huge surge in traffic volume. Yet many brands are pulling back and pausing their paid social media buys due to brand safety concerns, worries which may be unwarranted. <a href=""https://integralads.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Integral Ad Science</a> (IAS) conducted a recent survey and found three out of four consumers said their view of a brand whose ad was adjacent to coronavirus coverage would be unchanged. With that in mind, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/does-paid-social-work"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">running paid social media</a> rather than going dark during the pandemic could ultimately pay off. You could meaningfully connect with your audience and prospects and gain more share of voice, all at a lesser cost and with less competition than before. Read on to learn how COVID-19 is impacting paid social media: <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/covid-19-programmatic-trends/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">how it’s affecting U.S. advertising</a> and seven ways to make the greatest social media impact now.

·       <strong>Healthcare</strong>: While media spend decreased 35% January to March this year, click-through rates (CTRs) increased by 11%, CPCs went down 15% and CPMs dropped 5%.

·       <strong>Restaurant and Food Service</strong>: <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-impacting-the-restaurant-industry"">During COVID-19, a lot of traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants have shifted their offerings and messaging</a> to focus on drive-thru services, delivery, pickup options and donations to local food shelters. Many are also offering recipes using restaurant staples in make-at-home meals to help keep the dinner rotation fresh. As we get closer to the end of social distancing restrictions, consider shifting your ad messages to gift cards to encourage dine-in visits but also keep promoting delivery and pickup services, which will likely remain popular once COVID-19 ends.

·       <strong>Retail</strong>: With many brands pushing ecommerce purchases in place of brick-and-mortar shopping, implement a seamless user experience. Make sure your creative supports the purchase journey. And when customers want to make purchases online, give them the ability to do so across all device types, especially mobile. Just remember, if you have too many steps, slow load speeds and disjointed messaging, your conversion rate could take a dive. Think about connecting your product feed to Facebook or Pinterest for in-app shopping and streamlined retargeting. But if your business isn’t ecommerce ready, try Facebook and Instagram Live videos to showcase in-stock inventory and offer curbside pickup or free shipping for call-in orders.

·       <strong>Automotive</strong>: At Goodway, we saw a 21% dip in CPMs for auto brands from February to March and a 13% decrease from March to April. During that same period, CPCs dropped 11%. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-surefire-ways-small-businesses-can-navigate-COVID-19"">Since traditional car sales can be tough to generate during the pandemic, pivot your messaging</a> to provide essential maintenance and repair services and balance these offers with relief- and support-centered messages to maintain brand awareness and long-term customer loyalty.

How Can You Make the Greatest Paid Social Media Impact?

Though we don’t know when life will return to normal, use this time effectively to adjust your messaging and plan for the second half of 2020. Switch up tactics to continue to reach your audience through new channels such as Instagram and Pinterest. Our best advice? Plan for a variety of scenarios and support your paid media efforts these seven ways.

1)      <strong>Stay Positive</strong>. Social media followers look to brands for answers, solutions and positivity. Since consumers often will mirror behaviors from trusted brands, keep morale high and reward loyal customers for doing the same. Go with messages that thank customers for their continued support and consider showing your appreciation by offering a free gift or discount.

2)      <strong>Stand Out From the Competition</strong>. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/covid-19-4-step-conquesting-strategy"">Listen to what your competitors are doing</a> and what their customers are saying. Then develop a message to fill in the gaps and capture wavering customers from your competition. (For instance, if your competitors are offering free online workout videos for people at home, offer online workouts too, but tailor your videos to benefit essential workers who may need quick stress relief or an energy boost.) To further connect with your audience, be responsive. Comment quickly on social media to provide brand-specific answers at each consumer’s moment of need.

3)      <strong>Put Your First-Party Data First</strong>. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">Evaluate and update your first-party data</a> and CRM lists. Leverage lead generation social media ads to help build your database and fill in any data gaps on current customers. Review your current data collection processes and your strategy for putting it to use. This will make the most of your data when the virus starts to decline and normal spending resumes.

4)      <strong>Humanize Your Communications</strong>. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-to-respond-to-COVID-19"">Use your brand voice to emotionally connect with consumers</a>. As life begins to normalize, people will remember the sense of comfort your brand made them feel. Maintaining share of voice can pay dividends in the long run as some competitors go dark and their customers look for new options.

5)      <strong>Use All the Tools</strong>. Use social media tools like Live and Premiere videos to keep up communication with your audience. Not only will sharing regularly help you build positive brand sentiment for the future, you may be able to repurpose some of your content for future retargeting and brand awareness campaigns.

6)      <strong>Support Fundraising and Other Awareness Efforts</strong>. Run paid social media ads at lower costs and help your ad dollars reach even more people due to lower cost per thousands (CPMs). Scale and increase your charitable organization's recognition. For instance, within Facebook, a nonprofit can access <a href=""https://socialgood.fb.com/charitable-giving/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">free fundraising tools</a>, and individuals can raise funds on behalf of a nonprofit. Facebook doesn’t take a percentage either, so all raised funds go to the nonprofit, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/1251484118194936"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">if it qualifies</a>.

Business-to-business (B2B) marketers say events drive more engagement with customers than search and social efforts, and more than half of them rely on in-person events and trade shows to drive conversions. But with no safe way to gather as the pandemic wears on and with no definitive end in sight, now’s the time they must rethink and retool the foundation of their marketing or revenue strategy. To help, here are other effective channels that can drive customer engagement and conversion in lieu of physical events and four ways B2B marketers can succeed during COVID-19 by getting in front of registered audiences now:

 	<li style=""padding-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Consider Digital and Offline Alternatives</strong>: With events scrapped for the short term, what should Plan B be? Webinars, according to <a href=""https://www.demandgenreport.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Demand Gen Report</a>: One-third of marketers found webinars to be one of their most valuable content formats, and nearly two-thirds of consumers are willing to spend 20-60 minutes watching a webinar. Pivot and monetize a digital version of your physical event. But remember – with the influx of live and prerecorded webinars right now and because participants are likely suffering from webinar fatigue, rethink your content delivery beyond the typical webinar format to truly stand out from the crowd. For instance, <a href=""https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a32145012/best-zoom-backgrounds/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">create backgrounds your participants can use while on a Zoom call</a> (so many types are available, from Hallmark Channel to Star Wars to Disney themes and more!), <a href=""https://www.inc.com/geoffrey-james/10-rules-for-better-product-demos.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">conduct an interactive demonstration of your product</a>, or <a href=""https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/how-to-live-stream-checklist"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">do a live stream event</a> to make your presentation more personal. Or reach your intended audience with <a href=""https://mayvenstudios.com/blog/12-brilliant-direct-marketing-pieces-you-have-to-see"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">customized direct mail and use unique, visually appealing formats</a> to grab their attention.</li>
 	<li style=""padding-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Repurpose Content</strong>: Record your webinars; then use the content later to promote future events across all your advertising channels. Or host webinar recordings on your site to help drive traffic and capture new prospects. Registrants will likely appreciate the flexibility in consuming content – whether it’s attending the live webinar, viewing the recording at their convenience, or scanning their email or scrolling through social media later for your quick takeaways and tips.</li>
 	<li style=""padding-bottom: 20px;""><strong>Collect Quality Data</strong>: Focus on <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/data-strategy-playbook/"">data collection and your long-term strategy</a>, such as how you plan to put your data to use. Virtual events give you multiple touchpoints (Q&amp;A, polls, quizzes, comments, etc.) to connect with and engage current registered customers, so use this channel to keep registrants up to date and up to speed on your event and your plans. Gathering all this rich data right from the start can benefit you down the line too. For example, you can use the data to create a solid invitee list to use for future in-person events, once they can get back on the calendar again when the pandemic is over.</li>
 	<li><strong>Measure, Compare, Contrast</strong>: Look at the shift from in-person events to virtual events as an opportunity and measure well. What’s your data telling you? <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/prove_your_advertising_works/"">Is your marketing working</a>? Find out how effective in-person events and virtual events are and how they both affect your bottom line. Put key metrics in place to get a pulse on engagement from virtual efforts. Then compare and contrast those results with past in-person events to identify improvement areas and potential cost savings.</li>

When the pandemic swept through the United States, everything came to a stop; everything ultimately changed. That’s why now more than ever, how you communicate with customers and prospects is so important. Drop the tone-deaf hard-sell, “buy here, buy now” mantra. Instead, go with messaging that benefits the consumer, and make it suitable for the context in which it’s placed.

Which brands are communicating well in the midst of COVID-19? Jay says <a href=""https://www.zillow.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Zillow</a> and <a href=""https://www.hotels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Hotels.com</a> are good examples. Zillow gets to the heart of how we’re all feeling about our homes these days with its current tagline, “Now is the time you recognize how important your home is.” And Hotels.com pivoted well when it recently changed its tagline from “Be There. Do That. Get Rewarded.” to “Just Stay Home,” to promote social distancing efforts. Jay believes it’s the small, strategic changes, such as adjusting your messaging, that show consumers you’re listening, and you care.

This report among others and even a situation like COVID-19 can help pave the way for the ad tech industry to change in a positive way – to actively work to reduce waste and ad fraud and improve attribution and return.

But Jay emphasizes that all this work to change for the better shouldn’t fall squarely on the ad tech side alone. Brands also need to do their part. To start, he suggests adjusting your definition of performance, which means ending counterproductive practices to boost “performance” numbers (including double-counting conversions from multiple sources); aggressively rooting out fraud; and focusing on price more than value. Jay recommends working with trusted partners to determine meaningful KPIs, increasing transparency and reducing waste.

At a time when brands are doing wage reductions and furloughs instead of permanent layoffs to weather COVID-19, Jay says company culture and employee value are important elements to continue building now and into the future once the pandemic ends. Keep morale high and engage and encourage employees, and commend them for the work they’re doing and their accomplishments during these trying times.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">When customers do flock back to movie theaters, will movie theaters welcome them back with open doors? Both small and large movie theaters are struggling financially right now and doing their best to stay afloat. Even the largest theater operator in the United States, AMC Theatres, isn’t immune to financial woes. The company is looking at a long-term debt of $4.85 billion as a result of COVID-19. And back in March, AMC Chief Executive Adam Aron in a CNN interview said, “Literally we don’t have a penny of revenue coming in the door. Three weeks ago, AMC was an immensely healthy company. But now with expenses out the door and no revenues, we are burning through cash. What we need is liquidity, and only the government is going to provide that.” Now months later, AMC’s situation has only gotten more dire, to the point the company is at risk of <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/03/amc-has-substantial-doubt-it-can-survive-coronavirus-shutdown.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">going under</a>.</p>

To keep crowds at bay and to enforce social distancing, here are ways movie theaters can prepare to reopen. Consider upgrading typical theater seats to luxury loungers, which can naturally help space out guests in your auditoriums and think about staggering movie show times and reducing auditorium capacity for the short term. Put extreme cleaning protocols in place. Disinfect areas – bathrooms, concession stand surfaces and theater seats – much more frequently than usual and post signs when you do. Offer your employees easy access to cleaning supplies, sanitizer, masks and gloves to make them feel as safe as possible while working (and encourage customers to wear masks too). As an added safeguard, implement staff and customer temperature checks before entry as long as COVID-19 persists.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Go beyond selling gift cards or offering curbside popcorn pickup during COVID-19 by connecting with customers in new imaginative ways. Consider hosting <a href=""https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/whats-next-for-movie-theaters/2371491/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">quarantine crew events</a> – offering auditorium space for rent to individuals looking to host their own (socially distanced) party or to churches looking for space to hold weekly services. Or make use of this other unexpected asset, your parking lot.

Host your own double-feature movie nights or other community events throughout the summer such as comedy shows and concerts that people can enjoy together from the safety of their own cars.

With COVID-19 lockdowns starting to lift around the United States and some gyms and health clubs now reopening around the country, how do people feel about heading back to a public place for a workout? <a href=""https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/why-75-of-americans-are-not-comfortable-returning-to-gyms-after-quarantine/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Drive Research</a>, a New York market research firm, surveyed 600 gym-goers nationally in late May and found this: Three out of four respondents aren’t comfortable going back when their gym reopens. Though they’re likely eager to abandon their neighborhood walks or escape the confines of home for a trip to the gym, what are the biggest concerns that will keep people away? Survey participants said they felt they wouldn’t be able to trust gym members to follow new health and safety rules and that they were anxious about their health when having to <a href=""https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2020/06/10/face-mask-gym-debate-coronavirus-safety-precaution/3161272001/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">wear a mask</a> while exercising. To bolster consumer confidence and rebound after the crisis, this is what fitness marketers should do now to help their brands adapt and innovate for the post-pandemic routine:

<a href=""https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/why-75-of-americans-are-not-comfortable-returning-to-gyms-after-quarantine/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">The Drive Research survey</a> showed gym-goers’ greatest fear around going back to the gym was germs: on the equipment, in other communal areas and being too close to other members. For employees and guests alike, make health and safety your top priorities.

For employees, consider implementing health screenings before every shift and offering masks, gloves, sanitizer and plenty of hospital-grade cleaning supplies to make them feel as protected as possible while on the job. Keep ceiling fans going to help circulate the air and ensure all exercise areas are well-ventilated. Ensure employees frequently sanitize common areas and wipe down machines, at least hourly.

For guests, have them schedule workouts, at least for the short term. That way, you can easily monitor and cap gym capacity. Offer visitors contactless check-in and sanitizer as well as masks, water bottles and towels for sale. Naturally encourage physical distancing by spacing out your equipment to help keep people apart. Ramp up sanitation and cleaning by installing handwashing stations and providing cleaning spray bottles throughout the gym and make people wipe down all equipment before and after use. If possible, hire a professional cleaning crew to come in daily.

Once all your new COVID-19 health and safety protocols are in place, build your messaging around them. Share all you’re doing for guests and prospects to ensure their workouts are as safe and stress-free as possible. Consumers are paying careful attention to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/4-ways-b2b-marketers-can-succeed-during-covid-19"">how businesses respond during this period</a>, so providing support, demonstrating genuine care and concern and finding new ways to serve members will set up your brand for success. Exhibiting these values through your messaging and actions will result in a win-win for businesses and consumers.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">To help keep money flowing in during these difficult times, get creative and consider offering equipment for rent or sale. Days after a small indoor cycling studio was ordered to close when the pandemic began, the gym owner asked members this on Instagram: If you could rent one of our 56 stationary bikes for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, would you be willing to pay? All bikes were rented within a day, and members now pay $250 a month for the bike rental and an unlimited number of virtual classes. This is just one example of how in-home remedies can take on a whole new meaning for those who can’t afford to purchase equipment themselves. Fitness trainers can also <a href=""https://www.cnet.com/health/exercise-using-household-objects-for-a-full-body-workout-during-quarantine/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">incorporate household items</a> (chairs, water bottles, paint cans, etc.) into their virtual training sessions to make all attendees feel they can participate in workouts and achieve good results, even without traditional equipment.</p>

The $38 billion fitness industry was already battling new at-home smart bikes and trainers when the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic hit, further challenging its bottom line. And unlike past recessions which were primarily financial, the impact of a health-related recession means gyms and health clubs will be among the hardest hit. While these times may be filled with uncertainty and ups and downs, this is what fitness marketers should do now to win: Implement new health and safety measures, pivot and communicate new messaging to stay relevant with consumers, respond to an increasing demand for fitness-at-home options and make smart use of data.

The doctor can see you now – virtually. As emergency rooms fill up with COVID-19 cases and surgery centers and doctors’ offices reduce the number of people they see, the healthcare industry has had to rapidly retool how they operate to weather the pandemic. Here’s a look at healthcare now and how healthcare marketers can successfully prepare for the future.

Telemedicine is on the rise. Many consumers have shifted to using telemedicine for conditions that aren’t life-threatening to minimize their virus risk.

According to <a href=""https://khn.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Kaiser Health News</a>, “Millions of Americans are seeking care by connecting with a doctor electronically, many for the first time. Health systems, insurers and physician groups said it allows people to practice social distancing while reducing the spread of the disease and protecting health workers. Many hospitals have also recently added telemedicine services to keep patients concerned about the coronavirus from clogging their emergency rooms.”

These telemedicine services include new operations and processes, health-related wearables and text messaging programs so healthcare systems can successfully treat and educate patients from afar. And adding these services now during the crisis can pay off later. According to <a href=""https://www.gminsights.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Global Market Insights</a>, telemedicine was a $45.5 billion global industry in 2019 and is expected to grow to $175.5 billion by 2026.

While facing today’s influx of patients, prepare for a potential second wave of COVID-19 patients as states reopen and all the patients who deferred elective care or put off doctors' visits during the first part of the year. From a billing standpoint, rescheduling surgeries and visits are positives. But ensure your healthcare system can handle increased demand and address any operations gaps as needed. Train physicians and nurses on <a href=""https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2020/04/COVID-19-Telehealth-Best-Practices_final.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">virtual encounter best practices</a> and smooth out any technical issues with online scheduling or services. Delivering efficient care, whether in-office or online, is key to ensuring patients’ long-term loyalty to your healthcare brand.

Making an emotional connection is critical in these sensitive times. According to a recent survey by the <a href=""https://www.aaaa.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">American Association of Advertising Agencies</a>, 43% of people say they want messages that are “reassuring from the brands I know and trust.” Communicate clearly and work to connect with patients and prospects. Share all the careful planning you’ve done to ensure patient wellness and safety as your medical offices and specialty departments reopen. Patients who have put off elective surgeries and other doctor appointments will want your reassurance it’s safe to enter your offices. Build your go-to-market strategy now so when the time comes to reopen all your facilities, your patients and their guests will be confident all the proper health-related precautions have been put in place.

The brands that will fare best during COVID-19 and beyond are the ones who can both accelerate their telehealth capabilities and then promote them to the right audiences. The pandemic expedited the need for virtual care, but if you’re ready and able to promote those services through paid campaigns, you can capitalize in the long term. Patients realize they have more virtual and digital options for healthcare services than ever before, so shine the spotlight on the online services and remote monitoring tools you offer. Most importantly, regularly examine how your products are being received and how your messages are performing. Which ones are the most popular and successful? Once you identify them, shift your organic and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-impacting-paid-social-media"">paid media</a> creatives to align with those trends.

Showrooms have been closed for months. Supply delays from international manufacturers are building up. Domestic assembly interruptions are the new norm. The already struggling auto industry now must deal with a host of COVID-19 side effects. In fact, according to <a href=""https://www.canalys.com/static/press_release/2020/autoforecastmediaalert.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Canalys</a>, auto sales in North America are expected to drop 18% year-over-year as a result of the pandemic. But here are four ways auto brands can pivot and prevail during COVID-19.

Communicate frequently with your customers. Increase your long-term customer loyalty with timely communication, home delivery options, approachable customer support channels and responsive digital media. For instance, are your service department’s hours of operation updated on your website? Do customers know how to sign up for home pickup and drop-off services? Are you promoting virtual tours of your latest models so customers can get the experience from the comfort of their couch? Also, share your go-to-market strategy now, and highlight all the careful planning you’ve done and health-related precautions you’ve taken to ensure guest wellness and safety as your showrooms reopen. Most importantly, examine all your marketing messages and see which are receiving positive traction within your organic and paid media; then shift your creative to align with what you’re seeing.

2.      Prioritize  Emotional Connections.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Reach out to your customers during this sensitive time to power brand loyalty and longer customer lifetime value. Consider offering financial incentives for medical and first-responder employees or communities hardest hit by the pandemic. Don’t forget; you have technology on your side. Consider enhancing your online and mobile in-app experience so your customers can feel safe engaging with your brand throughout all phases of the pandemic. If you can offer contactless payments options and other contactless functions, such as “message a mechanic,” customers will feel at ease about buying from you. For example, during shelter-in-place periods, many marketers took the car shopping experience online as a way to adapt to the new normal and continue driving sales. Consumers quickly got onboard with online car shopping too! According to <a href=""https://www.cargurus.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">CarGurus</a>, one out of four buyers are willing to test drive a car via virtual reality and over half are willing to do financing and price negotiation online instead of in person due to COVID-19.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">first-party data is a treasure trove</a>, so put it to good use. Tap your most loyal customers for feedback as you test and streamline new services. Capture contact information from online tools to connect with consumers and encourage foot traffic into your showroom. Modeling audiences and learning more about your consumers’ patterns will help guide your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/data-strategy-playbook/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">data strategy</a> through COVID-19 and beyond.</p>

4.    Reassess Your Media Strategy.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The auto sales cycle tends to be longer, so going dark on your advertising during COVID-19 could have a lasting negative impact. While you may be reducing budgets overall, be sure to keep feeding the entire funnel so your brand remains top of mind when buyers are ready to purchase. One way to reduce budgets while maintaining share of voice is to reassess your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/covid-19-4-step-conquesting-strategy"">media strategy</a> and look for new digital channels that provide the targeting precision you need at more flexible price points. For example, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/advanced-tv-bother-guide/"">connected TV</a> and mobile are both strong awareness drivers that offer precise audience targeting. What’s more, with shifts in consumer media habits now, these digital channels are reaching more consumers than ever.</p>

Now six months later and with the clock ticking, the ad tech industry is rallying together to find third-party cookie alternatives so ad buying, targeting and attribution can prevail in the coming cookie-less world. Here's a quick look at the opportunities ad tech has now and 5 ways brands can prepare to go cookie-less.

Google’s deadline is looming, but at Goodway Group, we believe this is no cause for fear. Significant ad industry opportunities exist, and we’re innovating now to embrace and prepare for the industry changes that lie ahead.

Large publishers have one big opportunity. The demise of the third-party cookie gives them immense power because they know their audience. Any grouping of large publishers, either on their own or through a third party, could bring significant known-user scale across devices that rival the walled gardens of Google, Facebook and Amazon.

The browser community also has an opportunity to create a more privacy-friendly way to identify users, which still enables all the cookie benefits without the privacy downside. Why would browsers do this? Let’s not forget that the majority of the internet is free to users because it’s supported by advertising. Publishers must make money. Browsers may realize this and be willing to work with the advertising community on a fair solution.

As for Goodway, we’ve been engineering a solution for our clients for well over a year and are fully prepared to continue delivering significant value to clients well ahead of Google’s deadline. Our network of authenticated traffic (built through publishers and third-party technology platforms) already leads the industry in verified reachable identity, and this will only continue to build over time.

2.      Identify and Optimize Toward Contextual Signals.

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

Before buying audiences, marketers bought context, which means they would match their ad campaign topics and keywords to relevant sites with the same or similar content, and it worked. Spend the next nine months identifying and optimizing toward the contextual signals (keywords, video meta descriptions, audio transcripts, comments and more) that highlight your brand message.

To figure out what contextual signals work best for your ads and put your customers and prospects at the heart of your ad strategy, experiment and use A/B testing on your ad campaigns to improve campaign efficiency within even the first few weeks. Small changes will pay back steadily day after day for incremental gains that can drive the greatest impact for your brand and customers and lead to a big swing in ROI over the long term.

3.      Develop a Nimble Measurement Mentality and Set Reasonable Expectations.

The need to measure and optimize will not disappear with the cookie, but resetting and managing expectations among marketers may be required. The ideal solution will likely differ brand to brand. Industry experts even have different opinions on what measurement solutions are likely to rise to the top (marketing mix modeling vs. single-channel attribution, etc.)

However, it’s expected that offline identity will begin to play a much larger role as <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/expert-guide-online-offline-attribution"">linking online activity to known offline identifiers</a> could bridge the gap in current analytics lost post-cookies. It will be important for marketers to be open to new solutions and flexible when setting tactic and metric expectations moving forward.

A data strategy is simply the strategic plan you set and follow at your company to get your data in shape so you can leverage it to the fullest. It includes deciding who will be involved and the methods and processes you’ll implement to capture, identify, enhance, manage and activate your raw data so it can become accessible, usable, and shareable across your organization – and become one of your biggest assets.

Of course, setting a data strategy isn’t a one-time task. It requires ongoing work, vision and a lot of effort to make successful. Think of your data strategy as a road map to achieving your short- and long-term goals, crafted in such a way that it’s capable of meeting your existing needs and future ones too as your business changes, evolves and grows.

Unfortunately, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to setting a data strategy. Finding what works depends on what your company does and its maturity and corporate culture, among other things.

But no matter the situation or circumstances, anyone can successfully start here. Answer these questions first to lay a solid data strategy foundation:

<strong>The Data Strategy Planning Questions To Ask Yourself</strong>

<strong>Goals &amp; Objectives</strong>

·       What are your goals?

<strong>Segmentation and Modeling</strong>

·       How will you segment your audiences for activation?

·       Do you want to use <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">look-alike modeling</a> or offline modeling?

·       Can you use propensity modeling based on your data?

<strong>Activation</strong>

·       Where will you activate your audience segments?

How long will the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic ultimately last? Three more months? Six? Nine? Longer? And when it’s over, what will daily life, the workplace and commerce look like? Rather than trying to predict when the crisis will end and what life will look like after COVID-19, smart marketers are focusing on the future and on how consumer habits and behaviors are flexing now. To make it easier to keep a pulse on the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape without all the legwork, we’ve scoured our own resources and pulled together this COVID-19 update on digital insights and advertising trends just for you.

Streaming services have been the clear winner throughout the pandemic with over half of consumers in a recent <a href=""https://blog.globalwebindex.com/chart-of-the-week/coronavirus-story-so-far/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GlobalWebIndex</a> survey saying they've been watching more streaming content during this time. Multiple other studies back up this finding and identify this trend as one that's here to stay. Survey data from <a href=""https://luthresearch.com/infographic/panelist-survey-data-coronavirus-week-of-may-25/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Luth Research</a> in late May found that over 60% of consumers will continue or increase their number of subscriptions to streaming services once the pandemic ends and life gets more back to normal. <a href=""https://www.resonate.com/solutions/covid-19/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Resonate</a> also supports that finding. According to their data, 62% of consumers state they’re increasing their consumption of streaming TV, and 40% are increasing their consumption of streaming music.

Major streaming services are reaping the benefits of this uptake. Netflix added 15 million subscribers within roughly four months, and Disney Plus, which launched in November 2019, already has 54 million subscribers, putting it far above its original expected trajectory. Uncertain about their financial futures after COVID-19, consumers are also turning to ad-supported video-on-demand (AVOD) services as well, such as the Roku Channel, Crackle and YouTube. An April study by <a href=""https://insider.integralads.com/streaming-wars-wave-2-staying-at-home-with-ctv/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Integral Ad Science</a> found 44% of consumers added a free streaming service due to the COVID-19 situation – meaning plenty of new ways for advertisers to continue to reach their ideal customers throughout the pandemic.

Services that were beginning to scratch the surface of adoption at the beginning of the year rapidly accelerated at the start of the crisis as stay-at-home orders were put in place and people were afraid to leave their homes. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-impacting-the-restaurant-industry"">Digital and contactless services</a> like online grocery ordering, food delivery, curbside pickup and drive-throughs provided consumers with safer options.

These services are expected to be adopted for the long term now that consumers have become comfortable with the ease and convenience they offer. In fact, the same <a href=""https://luthresearch.com/infographic/panelist-survey-data-coronavirus-week-of-may-25/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Luth Research</a> survey found that about four in 10 consumers were planning to continue or increase their use of online grocery shopping and meal ordering throughout the pandemic.

All product categories have experienced massive growth in ecommerce as consumers continue to do most of their shopping from the safety and comfort of their homes. Most categories have seen more than 10% growth in their online customer base during the pandemic.

<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/4-ways-b2b-marketers-can-succeed-during-covid-19"">Businesses</a> that had no online presence before the pandemic had to move extremely fast to establish one, or risk going out of business. A July survey from <a href=""https://www.globalwebindex.com/coronavirus"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GlobalWebIndex</a> found that 50% of people expect to shop online more frequently after the outbreak is over – making that investment in an ecommerce platform worth it for long-term success.

Social Media and Messaging Level Out.

In the early days of the pandemic, social media stood out as a winner, and younger consumers are still dedicating a large amount of time to the medium. <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/content/us-adults-time-spent-with-mobile-messaging-apps-increasing-amid-pandemic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Twenty percent of consumers</a> still intend to carry on with using social media services and messaging apps after the pandemic is over.

However, <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/uptick-us-adults-social-media-usage-will-likely-normalize-post-pandemic"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer data</a> from June suggests that even though up to 51% of U.S. consumers were using social media at higher rates during the pandemic, the research firm believes consumers will eventually get back to their normal routines of school, work and social activities, allowing the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-impacting-paid-social-media"">social media trends</a> we're seeing now to moderate.

Social justice issues too added their own complexity to social media. By late May, the focus on social issues across the country resulted in campaign performance declines across all categories as people collectively paused their social media usage during Memorial Day weekend and the national protests. Social media advertising also began to experience hurdles as platforms put in place additional procedures for monitoring and flagging controversial topics. Pandemic-aside, July brought an entirely new crop of issues and changes for social media with the <a href=""https://www.stophateforprofit.org/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">#StopHateForProfit</a> Facebook ad boycott. Advertisers used that time to shift media from social platforms to other (safer) channels. Even though Facebook felt minimal pain from the last major advertiser boycott (remember <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Analytica"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Cambridge Analytica</a>?), some experts believe this boycott will be different and have bigger, more lasting effects if Facebook doesn’t implement structural change.

Are online education and remote work here to stay? Students and working adults seem to hope so. According to <a href=""https://www.globalwebindex.com/hubfs/1.%20Coronavirus%20Research%20PDFs/GWI%20coronavirus%20findings%20July%202020%20-%20Multi-Market%20Research%20(Release%2011).pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">GlobalWebIndex</a>, six in 10 Gen Zs and Millennials express a strong interest in enrolling in online learning programs, and over 40% of consumers would like to continue working from home.

Many companies across the globe are starting to realize <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/remotework/"">remote work’s benefits</a> like lower overhead costs and bigger talent pools (<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/remote-workforce-goodway-story/"">benefits we’ve realized at Goodway for over 12 years</a>), and some high-profile businesses such as Twitter have already announced they’re going to let it continue. It doesn’t stop there. Other major industries like <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-healthcare-marketers-can-prepare-for-the-future"">healthcare</a> and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/what-fitness-marketers-should-do-now"">fitness</a> are experiencing big shifts in their operating models with telehealth and virtual fitness products and services expected to stick around.

Win Rates and Average Bid Prices Rebound.

When the pandemic really started to take hold in the U.S., advertisers panicked and either went dark or significantly decreased their ad spending as they figured out how to navigate the uncertainty of a global pandemic. This caused competition within ad auctions to decrease dramatically, allowing advertisers to win more impressions.

Win rates increased 54% from early March to mid-April. By May, as the dust started to settle, competition began steadily rising even though win rates remained strong, and advertisers recognized the need to be present for their consumers. And by June, win rates started to increase in conjunction with average bid prices after a consistent months-long downward trend.

CPMs Remain Low.

As other metrics oscillate with the lockdown measures, reopenings and case counts, CPMs have remained below 2019 levels since mid-March. In April, while CPMs stayed low, CPCs were slowly creeping up, indicating that users were seeing more ads but were being more selective about where they chose to engage. When states began to reopen in June, CPMs inched up — a trend that's now reversing alongside a resurgence in COVID cases. This means there are still opportunities for advertisers to take advantage of lower CPMs to further their reach and spend efficacy in the digital space.

Beginning in April, mobile saw an uptick in performance as a result of increased focus on the medium. People have been heavily reliant on their smartphones as a means of entertainment and communication, even more so during the pandemic, and advertisers have enjoyed the benefit of increased conversion rates on mobile devices.

Regarding ecommerce, Amazon has been a clear winner in the space, as both a marketplace and as an advertising platform. Brands that have jumped on ecommerce and leaned into their online capabilities witnessed performance increases by the month of June.

Hundreds of measurements and data points exist in search marketing. While it’s important to pay attention to all these metrics directionally, don’t let yourself fall into the vanity metric trap. Instead, laser focus on those search metrics that will move the needle, that will drive the best performance. Of course, this comes down to your budget, category, customer and business goals, but generally if you laser focus, you’ll be successful in search.

Before you even think about specific search metrics, identify your primary goal and objectives at the start. If they’re not clearly defined and set initially, you can easily exhaust your resources on metrics that conflict with each other, which can hinder your success. It’s like rowing a boat. If one oar is rowing toward a ROAS goal and the other rowing toward a SOV goal, the boat may move, but not in the direction intended. Instead, you’ll waste energy, effort and investment rowing around in circles and never get to your destination.

When you have a clear understanding of your objectives, then you can  determine the key performance indictor (KPI) that most aligns with effectively measuring a primary performance goal.

Paid search goals fall into three categories:

1. Traffic-Focused Goals

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

These goals drive more customers to engage with your brand and website.

Metrics that align with traffic-focused goals include impressions, <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7103314?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">impression share, lost impression share due to budget or rank</a>, clicks and click-through rate (CTR).

CTR is the ideal standard KPI because it will measure the efficiency and effectiveness of your ad, the relevancy of your keyword and the traffic driver. Optimization and performance management can directly impact CTR while impressions and clicks rely largely on the searcher’s behavior and the budget. However, it’s important to note CTR may not be ideal for advertisers with small or strict budgeting parameters as low click volume can skew the percentage-based metric.

For traffic-focused goals, watch out for these potential vanity metric traps such as exit rate, bounce rate, time spent on site, SEO rankings, site content, metadata, view-through impressions, session duration, screenshots and mockups.

2. Cost-Focused Goals

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

These goals help you spend your budget effectively and efficiently. Consumer search behavior and interest drive the search channel, so seasonality plays a crucial role.

Metrics that align with cost-focused goals include lost impression share due to budget, media cost, average cost per click (CPC) and cost per action (CPA). If you want to track advanced metrics, look at budget impact, the point of diminishing returns and budget incrementality testing.

CPA is the ideal standard KPI because it will effectively measure valued actions as a result of budget spent.

CPC is not the best KPI for search because it can fluctuate wildly with every single keyword search participating in a <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6366577?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">real-time blind auction</a> for ranking. Watching CPCs, bidding and market rates by category is helpful when optimizing and leveraging bidding strategies, but you don’t have the direct control to force CPC rates.

Budget impact and point of diminishing return evaluations are costly and require significant volume to be statistically sound. So while these metrics are important for enterprise-level investments, they may be overly sophisticated for your current business economics or budget bandwidth.

For cost-focused goals look out for vanity metrics such as CPM, cost per thousand, (no cost for paid search impressions, so this metric is null and void), service fees, tech pass-through costs, revenue per search, lifetime value, production costs and creative costs.

3. Performance Goals

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" class="""" id="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""][/fusion_text][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

These goals drive customer actions that lead to performance results.

Metrics that align with performance goals include conversions, sales, leads, phone calls, cost per lead (CPL), revenue, profit, CPA, return on investment (ROI) and return on ad spending (ROAS). To track advanced metrics, look at attribution modeling, media mix modeling and cross-functional lifts.

Profit, ROI and ROAS are ideal standard KPIs because they measure the return on your investment. Unlike the other two metric groups, any of these measurements can be a strong KPI depending on the brand and goals.

If CPA is your KPI, first evaluate and determine a baseline with the volume of those actions, leads and conversions.

For performance goals, watch out for vanity metrics such as page views, and don’t focus much on metrics in other goal groups.

All metrics are important to the larger program in some way, but paying too much attention to any of these can distract you from spending time optimizing toward your primary KPI and can derail your campaign’s overall quality and performance.

To produce results and ensure industry excellence, optimize your primary KPI and spend your time and effort on paid search lead and lag measurements toward quality, relevancy and account performance that matter and make the largest impact.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">With so many measurements and metrics, oftentimes the optimization levers you’re pulling to achieve one goal can directly conflict with another. Consider this scenario:</p>
An eCommerce athletic clothing company wants to drive online sales and has selected ROAS, a performance metric KPI, for its paid search program. After a marketing meeting, the client wants to ensure the brand is serving in top position for the general keyword “fabric masks.” That’s because there’s an internal initiative to build content and research around which fabric is best for preventing the spread of germs. But this mask initiative, with conflicting measurements and metrics, doesn’t align with the brand’s primary goal. Fabric masks are also an aspiring content play for this client and not hyper-relevant to its existing brand or product offering. Pulling levers to drive ROAS versus the mask initiative differ and could negatively affect performance in both areas, impacting overall account quality and health.

Goodway Group is honored to announce a 2020 <a href=""https://martechbreakthrough.com/2020-winners/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MarTech Breakthrough Award win</a> for <a href=""https://www.prweb.com/releases/goodway_group_recognized_for_adtech_innovation_with_2020_martech_breakthrough_award/prweb17418432.htm"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Best Data Visualization Solution</a>. This is our first-ever tech win and is the culmination of years of hard work from our tech team on our dynamic marketing KPI reporting dashboards, which provide scale and visual performance information for brands with multiple locations.

The mission of the <a href=""https://martechbreakthrough.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">MarTech Breakthrough Awards</a> is to honor excellence and recognize the innovation, hard work and success in a range of marketing, sales and advertising technology-related categories. This year’s program attracted more than 2,750 nominations from over 15 different countries throughout the world, and we're truly humbled to have been selected as a winner.

We’ve been working in the distributed marketing, or <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/multi-location/"">multi-location advertising</a> space for over 12 years, and our robust suite of tools, resources and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/franchise-digital-marketing-consultant-checklist"">expertise for multi-location advertisers</a>, including retailers, dealers and franchises, allows them to easily scale and customize digital programs for their various local target markets. Our solutions minimize the administrative complexities that come with managing multi-location digital advertising, empowering brands with campaign performance reporting and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/media/"">programmatic expertise</a> to enhance media efficiency.

“An easy-to-understand visual representation of metrics is impactful for both location owners and experienced corporate marketers,” said <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/leadership/"">our president, Jay Friedman</a>. “With traditional advertising, a location owner can watch their TV ad by tuning in to the right show, but with digital, they often don’t see their ads because they aren’t part of the target audience. This causes a disconnect in understanding how digital advertising affects their business results, which makes our dashboards an educational tool as much as they are a reporting tool.”

Goodway Group’s visual dashboards can scale to any client’s needs, and each location owner receives a secure, mobile-responsive dashboard, providing them with access to their campaign metrics. Additionally, Goodway's tech team includes aggregation capabilities so that marketing managers at every tier can compare performance and see trends at every level.

The dashboards provide a visual representation of campaign metrics by time, which the user can adjust. At the individual campaign level, metrics are available with data visualization for categories including overall impressions, overall eCPA activities, channel-level impressions, channel-level eCPA activities and channel-level budgets. Additionally, different metrics populate for each channel’s sub-dashboard so that audio campaigns feature graphs and tables for impressions, completion rate and budget, whereas display campaigns feature impressions, eCPA activities, pixel activities and more.

Our data visualization capabilities drive real business outcomes, as shown by a recent example from a multinational automobile corporation. Back in 2019, the auto manufacturer wasn’t running any video campaigns in its western region. Our client services team educated them on video’s impact by showcasing the results of successful video campaigns in other regions via the dashboards. Presenting dashboard data was only one of many steps in the sales process, but the western region went from $0 in video at the start of 2019 to $2 million in video by the end of the year.

Furthermore, in the first six months of 2020, through the heart of the <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/covid-19-resources"">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the client was able to visualize the amount of impressions served and how many of those consumers then migrated to their individual websites and completed buying activities. We generated over 487,000 website activities with a cost per completed view of less than .05 cents.  In addition, CPAs decreased by 51% from 2019 to 2020 through campaign optimizations gleaned from dashboard insights.

There may never be another holiday season quite like this one. Fourth quarter sales from the holidays typically create a big year-end boost for brands, but the economic impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has many marketers wondering how to make the most of their media spend this year.

While <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/covid-19-update-on-digital-insights-and-advertising-trends"">COVID-19 upended almost every aspect of daily life</a>, it hasn’t stopped people from shopping. However, where, what and when consumers shop has changed. In the wake of the pandemic’s stay-at-home orders, people are shopping online more than ever and starting their holiday searches earlier than ever before. According to Google, 70% of <a href=""https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/pandemic-holiday-shopping/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">consumers plan to do their shopping even earlier this year</a> than in the past to avoid crowds during the pandemic. Plus, marketers must prepare for more cost-conscious consumers in 2020, as over 40% of people will be celebrating on a budget this season, according to Facebook research.

That’s why many advertisers are already in holiday mode, building and launching robust campaigns for the busiest selling season of the year. For those looking to take advantage of digital advertising to incentivize holiday shoppers, it’s not too late to build the perfect digital marketing strategy for every potential consumer. You can start with our tips below or dive right in and download our <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/holiday-advertising-playbook/"">2020 Holiday Advertising Playbook</a> to get ahead of the hustle and bustle that’s to come.

Ecommerce shopping was already on the rise in recent years, but COVID-19 fast-tracked consumer adoption in 2020, particularly among older generations. With safety top of mind for middle-aged and older adults, spending less time in stores has played a big role in shaping their <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-surefire-ways-small-businesses-can-navigate-COVID-19"">new shopping habits</a>. According to eMarketer, usage in buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) services that minimize human contact for buyers <a href=""https://content-na1.emarketer.com/podcast-free-shipping-drones-and-click-and-collect-oh-my"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">have surged 60.4% this year</a>, with sales reaching over $58 billion. And this trend will continue throughout the holiday season according to recent daVinci Payments research, which shows <a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200714005230/en/daVinci-Payments-Future-of-Payments-US-Study-Reveals-Online-and-Mobile-Domination"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">71% of all U.S. adults</a> and 60% of those over 55 say they plan to do more than half of their holiday shopping online this year. So marketers already using an ecommerce store should focus their efforts this fall on making the shopping process as seamless as possible.

Brands relying on past patterns or consumer behaviors to guide this year’s holiday advertising decisions will be at a disadvantage. While core audience demographics may not change significantly for some brands, consumer attitudes, consumption trends and buying behaviors are very much still in flux. This means there's an opportunity for agile marketers to re-evaluate shoppers’ needs and adjust their strategy to capture new market share. To target effectively, marketers must <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/planning-a-data-strategy-for-sweeter-results"">build new buyer personas</a> for their specific industry that will establish the right connection this holiday.

Holiday parties, shopping trips and family gatherings will look very different from past years and from state to state. National advertisers should be aware of regional regulations and choose ad creatives that match each market’s situation. It’s also especially critical that you deliver a consistent and hyper-relevant experience across every possible touchpoint. More and more, people are shopping for individual items throughout different points in their day using a variety of channels and devices to do it. So one approach is to break out your campaigns into the different stages of the customer journey and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-brands-can-recover-and-evolve-after-COVID-19"">personalize messages and outreach</a> to consumers based on their particular stage.

1. Identify New Customer Behaviors and Trends

Since the pandemic, where consumers shop, what they spend their money on and how they choose the products and brands they purchase from have shifted. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/marketers-guide-covid-19/"">COVID-19 upset the usual balance</a>, and experts anticipate these behaviors will continue to change long after the pandemic ends. Brands relying on past patterns or consumer behaviors to guide their advertising decisions will be at a disadvantage. However, for agile marketers, this means there are opportunities to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/covid-19-update-on-digital-insights-and-advertising-trends"">re-evaluate shoppers’ needs</a> and adjust their ecommerce ad strategy to capture new market share.

While your core audience demographics may not change significantly, consumer attitudes, consumption trends and buying behaviors are very much still in flux. To target effectively, throw past playbooks out the window and build new buyer personas and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/data-strategy-playbook/"">a data strategy that will establish the right connection</a> for the new normal. Monitor consumer behavior, needs and socioeconomic concerns across a variety of channels to inform your ecommerce ad strategy and develop relevant messaging. Then build in feedback loops to adjust to changing consumer trends in real time.

2. Optimize Your Product Pages

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

Before you can begin advertising your online store, you must ensure your site and product pages are retail ready. Creating a frictionless shopping experience throughout the entire funnel is key to motivating customers to browse, buy and come back often. Leverage a third-party ecommerce marketplace or build an ecommerce shopping platform into your site, such as <a href=""https://www.shopify.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Shopify</a>, <a href=""https://www.bigcommerce.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">BigCommerce</a> or <a href=""https://www.3dcart.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">3dcart</a>, to allow users to quickly browse and purchase your products online. Regularly review your product pages across every ecommerce platform you’re using and maximize this real estate with SEO-rich and <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/creative-best-practices-guide/"">visually appealing content</a> to lay the foundation for a successful user experience.

3. Advertise First With Amazon's Sponsored Ads

While there are many channels and platforms available to drive ecommerce activities, how much you invest in each channel relies heavily on your budget. For those new to ecommerce advertising, we recommend starting with <a href=""https://advertising.amazon.com/solutions/products/sponsored-products"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Amazon’s Sponsored Product Ads</a>. They’re simple to set up and because these ads are triggered by shoppers specifically searching for your product or similar products, your budget is optimized to only the highest-intent users. These placements can make a quick impact on your bottom line; then you can use the real-time data and results from that campaign to fund waterfall budgets with other publishers.

4. Adjust Keywords as You Go

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

Retail websites and search engines are generally query-based. That’s why it’s critical for marketers to make sure shoppers can find their brand and products with a strong <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/search-metrics-that-matter"">organic and paid keyword strategy</a>. Experiment with your keywords based on the season, new trends and consumer behavior shifts. Keep an open mind when creating your initial keyword list and gradually fine-tune it – pausing low performers as needed and continually testing new options.

5. Think Holistically To Expand Your Reach

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

As you begin to expand your ecommerce advertising plan, it’s important to remember that every marketing effort you implement has an impact on your other investments. And it’s through combining these efforts that you maximize effectiveness and create a virtuous customer cycle. So marketers must strive over time to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-step-holistic-marketing-formula"">create a holistic advertising strategy</a> that incorporates additional marketplace ads, promoted social posts and display and video ads on the open web for maximum reach and alignment with the full customer journey.

The majority of search engine marketing (SEM) is designed to <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167111?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6167087"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">target by keyword</a> searched. Based on your budget and goals, determine a healthy mix of keywords, such as brand, non-brand, long-tail, geomodified and their variations to appeal to your customers and prospects.

Unlike other channels, with paid search, you aren’t buying inventory. You’re bidding on keywords in a real-time blind auction. <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167110?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Choose keywords</a> relevant to your brand that with good account health and quality trigger your ad to be served on a searcher’s personalized search engine results page (SERP).

<strong>Choosing Keywords</strong>

So. Many. Choices. It can be overwhelming when you’re tasked with selecting the right keywords for your search campaigns. How do you know which ones are the right ones? Follow this process to make choosing easier: Put on your consumer hat. What keywords would you search for? Consider targeting behavior beyond the self-indicated search term to align your budget and efforts to your goals. Don’t forget to stay up to date and leverage <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6167100"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">match typing</a> to adopt the most recent keyword mapping nuances that differ for every search platform.

<strong>Structuring Your Account</strong>

How you structure your paid search account is crucial; it can make or break your success. Set up your keywords and match typing, your ad groups, bidding technology and the landing page to offer a good experience to searchers.

A few years ago, paid search was only keyword-based and focused on keywords and geographic locations. Now there’s a variety of <a href=""https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/2497941?hl=en"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">audience targeting strategies</a> you can use and layer on top of keyword targeting to help you reach the right people with your message at the right time.

To determine what audiences to target, think through and answer these questions: Who is your core audience? What are people searching for? How does your target audience’s behavior differ from other key audiences you want to reach? What do your audiences look like across other media channels such as programmatic and social? What is your target audience’s persona and behaviors? Do you have first-party data? Are you using retargeting?  Do you have a different messaging strategy for retargeted searchers?

<strong>Understanding the Current Targeting Strategies</strong>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Customer match targeting</strong> is when you use the first-party data you own with all the online and offline info you know, to reach existing customers.</li>
 	<li><strong>Remarketing</strong> is when you reach people who have shown interest in what you have to offer, who have visited your website or interacted with you in the past.</li>
 	<li><strong>Affinity targeting</strong> is when you reach people based on their lifestyle, their passions, hobbies and interests.</li>
 	<li><strong>Look-alike targeting</strong> is when you reach people who have similar characteristics to your existing customers or prospects.</li>
 	<li><strong>In-market targeting</strong> is when you reach people who have researched and are actively considering purchasing from you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Demographic targeting</strong> is when you reach people based on common traits such as gender, age, income or marital status.</li>
 	<li><strong>Keyword targeting</strong> is when you show ads based on what people search for within search engines or when they visit webpages that contain your keywords.</li>
</ul>

Paid search audience targeting methods should vary based on the type of searcher you’re trying to reach. For people who have interacted with your brand before, mine your first-party data and try customer match targeting. For those who have interacted with your website or other media before, try remarketing. If you want to reach people who haven’t interacted with your brand yet, try affinity, look-alike, in-market and demographic audience targeting. Or for those people simply searching that you don’t know anything about yet, choose keyword targeting.

But remember there’s no one cookie-cutter approach for paid search success. The important thing is to experiment with all these audience targeting methods, as your budget allows, to discover what works for you.

While online shopping was on the rise prior to 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic accelerated consumer adoption in ecommerce well beyond analysts' expectations. And the trend isn’t slowing down! According to <a href=""https://www.wundermanthompson.com/insight/the-future-shopper-report-2020"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">recent industry research</a>, nearly two-thirds of consumers said they expect to use digital shopping channels more as a result of COVID-19.

As brands battle for consumer attention in this unprecedented era of ecommerce, marketers are challenged with finding the right channel and platform that will help their brand stand out from the crowd. There are many advertising options available to drive ecommerce activities, but how much you invest in each channel relies heavily on your budget. That’s why for most advertisers, we recommend starting with search engine and online marketplace advertising before expanding out to other ecommerce tactics.

If you are looking to capture browsers at the bottom of the funnel, paid search ads may be a good fit. Find out more about these ads and if they make sense for your brand in our FAQs below:

These ads are triggered by shoppers specifically searching for your product or similar products on a search engine (like Google or Bing) or on an online marketplace (like Amazon.com, Walmart.com or eBay.com), meaning your budget is optimized to only the highest-intent users. By getting in front of these leaned-in customers when they’re actively searching for companies or products like yours, you <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/search-metrics-that-matter"">focus on driving the lower-funnel results</a> that matter most to your business. Plus, these ads typically serve above organic listings, giving you more prominent placement and control over the messages shoppers see.

The biggest players in the space are Amazon, Google, Bing and Walmart. Begin with one publisher – we most often recommend Amazon first – and prioritize products with the best margin or inventory levels. Focus on the placements that can make the quickest impact on your bottom line with a single publisher; then <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/build-digital-campaign-strategy-insights/"">use the real-time data and results from that campaign</a> to fund waterfall budgets for the other publishers.

Brands typically need a store or merchant account and product feed set up with the publisher. Each site will have different feed specifications, so it’s crucial that you monitor your feed regularly and ensure it stays up to date with all platform requirements. Product reviews, ratings, shipping tags and return policies may also factor into your ad eligibility on certain platforms like Amazon and Walmart.

Some publishers require a minimum monthly spend so it’s important to remember that if you allocate your budget across too many efforts, you won’t win at any of them. Instead, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-step-holistic-marketing-formula"">align your ecommerce advertising strategy to the channels most relevant to your goals</a> and stay flexible.

Yes. For most people, online shopping is synonymous with Amazon. It’s the world’s largest online retailer with consumers ordering items from Amazon 6.5 times per month on average – more than any other online marketplace according to Wunderman Thompson. Still, their research shows only 38% of digital consumer dollars in the U.S. are spent with Amazon. That means brands looking to convert online shoppers must think outside of the box and tap into Amazon Advertising's reach, even if they have their own ecommerce marketplace.

Ensure consumers in the discovery and consideration phases can find your products wherever they do their research and then bring them back to your own digital marketplace for additional or future purchases, if necessary. That’s why our team frequently recommends advertisers use Amazon Advertising search ads as part of their evergreen plan and ramp up with additional budget during peak holiday seasons. But remember, these search ads are served only on Amazon.com and drive users to the brand's Amazon storefront for purchase, so you must have an Amazon Store with products available to use these ads.

Yes. Every day, millions of people turn to search engines and online marketplaces to find, discover and shop for products. But most online shoppers never click past the first page of search results, so <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/silver-global-search-award"">promoting your products through paid search ads is vital</a> to ensuring they actually see your brand. Working in tandem with your organic SEO efforts, paid ads can provide a more complete picture of your target users’ behaviors and interests so you can continue to develop even more personalized customer experiences.

Plus, advertising campaigns that use both shopping ads and traditional search ads in parallel with SEO efforts typically increase consumer engagement and perform better than those that use one tactic alone. To further improve your performance potential, ensure at least 10 to 20 SKUs are eligible for advertising, including a mix of established best-selling SKUs and opportunity SKUs for new and seasonal products.

Retail websites and search engines are generally query-based. That’s why it’s critical for marketers to make sure shoppers can find their brand and products with a <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/do-not-google-own-keywords-sem-strategies/"">strong paid search keyword strategy</a>. Keywords and phrases match ads with search terms shoppers are using to find products on search engines and online marketplaces. They also allow advertisers to avoid showing their ads to consumers who use certain keywords or phrases in their search. To take your ecommerce advertising keyword strategy to the next level, consider these three tips:

1.     Keep an open mind when creating your initial keyword list and gradually fine-tune it based on the strongest performers. Ongoing experimentation is vital to keeping your keyword strategy at its strongest.

2.     On platforms that offer automatic keyword targeting, let the platform’s algorithms identify the best-performing keywords. Then add in manual targeting over time for more granular phrase mining.

3.     Separate your search campaign keywords thematically and replicate that process for each product at the ad group level to identify the right keyword-product combinations that deliver optimal results.

Social media has always been where consumers go online to connect with the people and things they love. More recently, social platforms have expanded to enable shoppers to connect with the brands and products they love too through paid social ads.

Social accounts for 13% of all time spent online in the U.S. according to <a href=""https://www.emarketer.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">eMarketer</a> – that’s 1 in every 8 minutes of browsing! So it should come as no surprise that more and more ecommerce advertisers are turning to social media to help people do more than just casually browse. They’re helping people get inspired, find new products and make purchases.

Case in point, <a href=""https://www.yotpo.com/blog/top-acquisition-channels/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">over 60% of direct-to-consumer brands worldwide list social as the leading customer acquisition channel</a> according to Yotpo. Paid social ads are also a great way for emerging brands or small businesses to expand their ecommerce strategy without a large advertising budget. But social media best practices vary greatly from platform to platform. If you aren’t sure if paid social is right for your ecommerce business, find out more about these ads and if they make sense for your brand in our FAQs below:

The biggest players in the space are Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest and Snapchat. Online stores and product listings on these platforms are a new way for shoppers to discover your brand and buy your products, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/how-covid-19-is-impacting-paid-social-media"">especially during the pandemic</a>. Factor in each platform’s exclusive data targeting as well, and everyone from small business owners to global brand marketers can gain confidence knowing their paid search ads are personally relevant and will inspire action among the people they want to reach.

Begin with one platform – we most often recommend Facebook first due to its extensive first-party data – and prioritize products with the best margin or inventory levels. Focus on the placements that can make the quickest impact on your goals with a single platform; then <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/build-digital-campaign-strategy-insights/"">use the real-time data and results from that campaign</a> to fund waterfall budgets for the other platforms.

Ecommerce brands typically need a shop or business account and product feed set up with the platform before you can begin advertising. Each social platform will have different feed specifications, so it’s crucial that you monitor your feed regularly and ensure it stays up to date with all platform requirements.

While we recommend building out your ecommerce strategy to run across multiple social media platforms over time, you should never duplicate creative content. Instead, vary your messaging from platform to platform to help prevent creative fatigue. A robust set of <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/creative-best-practices-guide/"">ad creatives in a variety of formats for desktop and mobile</a> is necessary to capture the attention of potential buyers and share your brand message in a way that fits how consumers use social media.

While an organic social media presence is key to your overall branding efforts, the number of things a consumer can watch, listen to and read on social is infinite. This means social platforms have largely shifted to a pay-to-play model, using algorithms to sift through the abundance of noise and streamline what users see. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/does-paid-social-work"">To get in on the best social media real estate</a>, marketers must supplement their organic initiatives with paid campaigns.

Because social platforms are creative-driven, it’s important to feature <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-creative-ads-love/"">attractive product images and videos</a> to streamline the online shopping experience and make it easy for consumers to visually search for products. Therefore, brands with highly visual offerings, such as clothing, beauty products or accessories, are a natural fit. Also, advertisers targeting younger audiences with their products are ideal for newer platforms like Snapchat, as 83% of its 84 million users are Millennials or Generation Z according to eMarketer.

Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the world has changed dramatically. Where consumers shop, what they spend their money on and how they choose the products and brands they purchase from have shifted. The pandemic upset the usual consumer behavior balance, and experts anticipate these behaviors will continue to change long after the pandemic ends. For agile marketers, this means there’s an opportunity to re-evaluate shoppers’ needs and adjust their strategy to capture new market share. For example, almost half of U.S. shoppers say they will be celebrating the holidays on a smaller budget this year than in previous years according to <a href=""https://commercenext.com/category/covid-19/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">CommerceNext</a>. So smart marketers will look for ways to make consumers feel like they’re getting a deal this season. For ecommerce marketers, advertising on comparison shopping engines may be a good fit.

What are comparison shopping engines?

Comparison shopping engines, also known as price comparison websites, showcase similar products or offerings from multiple retailers on the same page so consumers can evaluate the options side by side. Shoppers on these sites – like <a href=""http://www.pricegrabber.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">PriceGrabber</a>, <a href=""https://www.bizrate.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Bizrate</a> and <a href=""http://www.shopzilla.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Shopzilla</a> – are actively looking for a good deal, so brands list their products and pricing alongside competitors’ items to give buyers a clear apples-to-apples perspective.

For advertisers, this means they can upload product data feeds and set their bids by product or product category. Because most comparison shopping engines operate on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis, the advertiser doesn’t pay unless a user clicks on their product listing.

Once a user clicks on your ad on a comparison shopping engine, they’re sent directly to your website to complete the purchase. However on most online shopping marketplaces, the purchase takes place on the marketplace’s website.

Because comparison shopping engines rely on the brand’s product feed, advertisers must have a well-organized inventory system and data feed already set up. Each site will have different feed specifications, so it’s crucial that you monitor your feed regularly and ensure it stays up-to-date with the engine’s requirements.

While your core audience demographics may not have changed significantly in the wake of the pandemic, consumer attitudes, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/marketers-guide-covid-19/"">consumption trends and buying behaviors are very much still in flux</a>. Plus, temporary layoffs and economic uncertainty may cause some shoppers to purchase with more caution than ever before. Comparison shopping engines let you expand your reach beyond your website to find new customers who might be interested in your products and a good deal more now than in the past.

Comparison shopping engines only redirect customers to your site who have seen your product and price details and actively clicked on the ad. This means you’re only receiving high-intent consumers who have a greater chance of converting into a sale. What’s more, because the purchase happens on your site, you can more easily remarket buyers to generate repeat sales and stronger lifetime value.

This is a very niche tactic only recommended for advertisers with a detailed product feed and competitively priced products. Also, it’s important to only drive demand for what’s in supply and closely monitor your shipping cutoff dates, so this tactic doesn’t work well for products that quickly run out of stock or that require long production and shipping timelines.

Will measurement be different soon because of data privacy concerns?

Measurement will probably be worse in the future. But even with all the measurement capabilities available currently, the majority of marketers only include a few in their toolbox. Marketers are given this professional auger, but the hole they dig is only big enough for a sprinkler head. Too many are still stuck on last-click attribution today (or last-touch, if focusing on viewthroughs) instead of looking at other metrics such as incrementality, both by channel and by message.

There are so many different ways to measure lift. I do believe that as some of these tools are shifted, we will not be unable to measure lift and incrementality, but it will be a little more challenging and broad. My hope is that, let’s say the tools never change, 10 years from now, I would hope that 80% of marketers instead of 20% of marketers are really advanced. I think this maybe slows the progression.

How should advertisers and their agencies proceed without third-party cookies?

Though Google and the digital advertising industry have yet to choose what identity solutions will replace the third-party cookie, measuring an advertising campaign’s effectiveness will still be the main goal.

Whatever identity solutions are implemented will be more challenging than the cookie. So I advise advertisers and their agencies to continue using all the tools they have in their arsenal while they have them – while also developing new tools on a parallel track.

Our Paul Frampton, president of Europe, recently explained it like this:

“Programmatic is a way of media buying, NOT a channel. In fact, TV, audio, digital out-of-home (DOOH) and other media channels are fast adding programmatic scale because it’s the art of using tech and data to buy audiences effectively and efficiently,” he said.

Amazon knows what shoppers are in the market for. Take advantage to <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/paid-search-advertising/"">get in front of customers when they are searching for products like yours</a> on Amazon and drive the results that matter most to your business. Amazon’s paid search ads (including sponsored brand ads, sponsored product ads and sponsored display ads) are triggered by shoppers specifically searching for your product or similar products.

Remember, seven out of ten Amazon customers never click past the first page of search results, and the top three items displayed in the search results account for nearly two-thirds of all clicks according to <a href=""https://www.searchenginejournal.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Search Engine Journal</a>. So promoting your products through Amazon Advertising’s search ads is vital to generating conversions. That’s why <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/new-customers-are-just-a-search-away/"">we recommend ecommerce advertisers use Amazon’s paid search ads</a> as part of their evergreen plan and ramp up with additional budget during peak holiday seasons to drive sales among the highest-intent users. Increase product visibility with ads directly in shoppers’ search results, and you’ll be on your way to driving more lower-funnel activity.

On average, U.S. consumers own eleven connected devices per household including seven smart screens, according to <a href=""https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/u-s-households-have-an-average-of-11-connected-devices-and-5g-should-push-that-even-higher-1203431225/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">a recent Deloitte study</a>. Since your customers don't browse, research and buy in a silo, why would you spend your ad dollars that way? Using Amazon’s <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/difference-between-dsp-and-ad-network/"">demand-side platform (DSP)</a>, we can buy all your digital inventory [including desktop display, mobile, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/programmatic-video-explained/"">video</a> and over-the-top (OTT) ads] programmatically at scale for seamless cross-device coverage on and off Amazon’s site. And you don’t need to sell products on Amazon to use their DSP.

Our experts can help you <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-steps-capturing-retail-traffic-connected-tv"">take advantage of Amazon’s data across hundreds of retail categories</a> to reach your customers wherever they are shopping.

For most people, online shopping equals Amazon. It’s the world’s largest online retailer with consumers ordering items from Amazon 6.5 times per month on average – more than any other online marketplace – according to Wunderman Thompson research. Meaning its millions of shoppers leave behind a valuable trail of information about themselves, creating a treasure trove of data that can enhance targeting precision. So you can leverage a unique combination of your own first-party data and Amazon’s exclusive audience segments to <a href=""https://www.adexchanger.com/agencies/optimizing-programmatic-to-real-time-sales-data-can-improve-roas-especially-in-a-crisis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">enhance targeting precision based on what users have searched for</a>, viewed, subscribed to or purchased.

<em>Why should you use a partner like Goodway to help you <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/data-strategy-playbook/"">build a smarter data strategy</a></em>?

Often when brands try to leverage Amazon’s data in-house, they layer on too many niche targeting parameters and end up limiting the campaign’s reach.

With a fresh new year comes an exciting new distinction: <a href=""https://adage.com/bestplaces2021"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Goodway Group just ranked third on the Ad Age Best Places to Work 2021 list</a> of marketing, media, advertising or ad tech companies with over 200 employees.

Ad Age produces the Ad Age Best Places to Work competition, now in its third year, in conjunction with Latitude Research. The final results were tallied based on the findings from two surveys, a company questionnaire and a confidential employee questionnaire specifically designed to capture how a company performs in the following areas that matter most to employees: company culture, company environment, employee benefits, employee development, employee engagement  and employee perks.

Goodway’s top marks in the above Ad Age key scoring categories were what separated us from other well-known media agency and digital company contenders to go on to achieve one of the highest numerical scores on the list.

“From the challenges of the pandemic and a recession to the opportunities to stand up for social justice, diversity and inclusion, 2020 was a remarkable year for the advertising industry,” said Dan Peres, editor-in-chief, Ad Age. “Amid all of this, the Ad Age Best Places to Work winners went above and beyond in supporting their employees and communities.”

For over 13 years, Goodway has been a remote work leader. When the pandemic hit, fortunately we were already structured to not miss a beat in a new world where working from home became the norm. So we assumed it was our remote work expertise along with our robust employee benefits and perks that propelled us to the top of the Ad Age Best Places to Work list.

Yet, Ad Age said those weren’t the deciding factors. What gave us the edge? <a href=""https://adage.com/article/best-places-work/best-places-work-2021-goodway-group/2302576"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">It was how we put employees first</a> during a tumultuous year. But this was no different than <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goodway-group-celebrates-90-years"">how we’ve operated for over ninety years</a>: We've always succeeded by caring about one another and treating employees like family.

“When advertising revenue dropped in early 2020, we were really torn about how to keep our people and our team together,” Kandi Gongora, our VP of people and organizational development, said. But the solution quickly became clear. To ensure our entire team stayed intact, all our 371 employees, including our two owners, took temporary pay cuts to ensure zero furloughs or layoffs. The goal was Goodway would pay back every penny as long as it met its reduced annual target for the year, and we  accomplished this by early December 2020. Not only were we able to pay our staff back in full, we also were able to return pay levels to normal.

In addition to keeping the team together in 2020, Goodway implemented new programs to boost employee morale and support as we navigated a remarkable year. Here’s a look at a few:

<strong>Voluntary Employee-Funded Financial Assistance Program</strong>

Goodway established a fund to offer employees confidential financial assistance for needs both large or small, such as supporting family members who lost their jobs or taking care of sick pets.

<strong>Respect, Inclusion, Support and Equality (RISE) Initiative</strong>

We respect our employees and are committed to workplace diversity and cultivating a culture of inclusion and belonging through our everyday practices to continually move Goodway forward. “As a family business, we want every person at Goodway to feel like they are part of the family,” Kandi said. “Since we are remote, connections are really important, and we saw this even more so during 2020. <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/careers/"">We strive to support our team members</a>, enabling everyone at the agency to perform at their best while creating, fostering and preserving a work environment where everyone feels welcomed and heard.”

<strong>Community Resource Groups</strong>

Our community resource groups give employees the opportunity to share different perspectives and ideas, build skills for further growth and development and explore special interests by participating in cooking and crafting tutorials, fitness and meditation classes and more. For instance, to help working parents strike a better work-life balance during the pandemic, Goodway even offers company-led virtual childcare, tutoring services and kid-friendly events.

But our Amanda Martin, VP of enterprise partnerships, isn’t one of them. Quite the opposite. She’s feeling optimistic about the path forward, and though she knows challenges lie ahead, she’s already found the silver linings. Read on or watch now as she explains to <a href=""https://www.magnite.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Magnite</a> why the future of digital marketing is bright.

1) Losing the Cookie, Gaining an Opportunity

Having to give up the third-party cookie isn’t worrying Amanda. “I think we’ve painted this as a kind of ‘sky is falling’ situation, but I look at it as a true opportunity. This is our time to <a href=""https://digiday.com/sponsored/the-future-of-identity-and-addressability-is-people-based-ids/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">fix an infrastructure</a> that was never solid and wasn’t meant to be built upon to the manner it has been. So for me, the cookieless future is actually a better future than the one we exist in today,” she said.

Amanda knows there will be hurdles to clear, of course, and the ad tech industry will have to do things differently on the way to a better cookieless future, but she thinks all this change is good and buyers should keep a positive outlook. “In the end, we’ll have a far safer consent-oriented landscape we’re working in that respects the users’ privacy as well as the brand’s needs,” she said. “And that will get us in a better place for programmatic to grow in the way and to the size it should.”

In the interim, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/goodway-group-named-a-2020-adexchanger-programmatic-power-player/"">Goodway Group</a> is primarily <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-party-data-targeting/"">focusing on our brands’ first-party data</a> and working on their <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-simple-steps-audience-first-data-strategy"">valuable data assets</a> to help them lay a solid foundation that will withstand the test of time. Even as we all <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-ways-to-say-goodbye-to-cookies"">prepare to say goodbye to cookies</a> and work to hammer out new identity solutions that will benefit the open internet, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">how brands use their first-party data</a> moving forward will play a large role in how well they’re able to reach and engage consumers in the coming cookieless world. Amanda added, “What we’re doing is working with brands to redefine key performance indicators (KPIs) that maybe won’t be available anymore and leading them down a path of identifying metrics for success that work today and will work in the future.”

2) Embracing Collaboration

One thing Amanda finds uplifting about losing the third-party cookie? “What I’m really excited to see is that this issue transcends any one company, and it affects everyone. I think it’s actually the first turning point in maturity for our industry  to actually create a collaboration that we haven’t seen in the past,” she said. “It forces everyone in our industry to come together.”

All of us working toward the shared goal of finding new identity solutions to replace the third-party cookie is a major stride forward when you consider the ad tech industry incentivized companies to work alone rather than together in the past. Amanda said, “I’ve seen conversations that used to always stay at the conversation level now transcend into action, and so if that continues, I feel confident we’ll come up with solutions built for the future of digital marketing that are far better than the ones we have today.”

Amanda thinks with all this close collaboration, the data ecosystem will also improve. “With all the cookieless changes, regulations and consumer consent concerns, I think we’ll get to a place where we’ll value quality over quantity, which will ensure brands are truly buying the quality inventory they’ve always strived to achieve,” she said. “At the same time, consumers will also enjoy a better ad experience because the value proposition between consumers and brands will be more honest and transparent, and will help drive up everyone’s results in the end.”

3) Evolving Ad Tech's Programmatic Supply Path Optimization

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

Supply path optimization (SPO) is a really important piece of the ad tech ecosystem, and Amanda believes everyone should be participating. She said, “It’s really grown in importance because the tools the industry has created and continues to iterate on afford us insight into more information than we’ve ever had on the buy side, which allows us to action off of signals that we didn’t even imagine, say, two years ago.”

SPO may be a little misunderstood. It's not all about fees and shrinking the middle. “Though I think SPO started out in this kind of transparency fight to the bottom fee structure, it’s evolved far beyond this at this point,” Amanda said. “Today, I think it’s far more about value and the path to the end publisher and the end user that the brand desires. It’s all about efficiency on the buy side – knowing the value of the inventory you’re buying and guiding brands to the best inventory possible.”

So <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/tackle-supply-path-optimization-like-a-pro"">how do you ensure SPO success</a>? Amanda said that’s a bit hard to nail down. “It’s an iterative process. You have to consistently be working on SPO and tweaking it because the ecosystem is also tweaking it on the sell side, and it’s not something you can simply set and forget,” she said. “To be successful, you have to define your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/incremental-lift"">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a> as a brand or an agency and really stick to driving those metrics and then reassess them on a given cadence so your goals continue to match up with the ad tech industry’s latest advances.”

Reassessing is exactly what Goodway has had to do. Over the past four years, how we’ve handled SPO as a performance marketer has changed a lot. Amanda explained, “In the beginning, SPO was really a manual partnership and relationship game. But it’s taken a technological turn of late that’s allowed us to change our bidding strategies. Now, we work with our DSP and SSP partners to improve the efficiency of how we buy and, in the end, get more working media dollars into the publisher’s hand. We’re no longer turning SPO off then on again. Instead, we’re now taking a fine-tuned approach, one that allows us to use all the technology and API configurations we have at our fingertips.”

1) Harness Your Own Data

Tap into your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/put-first-party-data-first/"">first-party data</a> to drive results and return on investment (ROI) by using the data-driven marketing process we at Goodway Group use ourselves:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Take it one step at a time</strong>. Keep it simple to start. Identify and get a hold of the data assets you have (even if your <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/first-party-data-targeting/"">first-party data</a> is laid out in a disparate or disconnected manner).</li>
 	<li><strong>Think about what you want to solve</strong>. Have a hypothesis and broader goal of what you seek to achieve before you even make decisions about using a customer data platform or DMP, building something on your own, or investing in tech stacks, custom data integrations and more.</li>
 	<li><strong>Curate the right custom audience targeting and segmentation strategies</strong>. Base your decisions on real data rather than gut feel.</li>
 	<li><strong>Test and learn</strong>. Start with simplistic tests that answer larger high-leverage test first. Then get granular and iterate and refine as you go to inch closer to your goal over time.</li>
</ul>
Throughout the process, Ben says the most important thing is “to stay flexible and not let perfect be the enemy of the good.” “As you test different data segments, different platforms, different ways to get in front of the right users at the right time, where your attention goes, where your time goes will shift and change. That’s OK,” he says. Your data strategy is a journey.”

Though while you’re on that journey, Ben cautions, “Whether you’re testing creative iterations for a media strategy or different audiences you’re targeting for a prospecting strategy, the key is to not test too many things at once or you can end up not learning anything.”

2) Create Custom Audience-First Segmentation

[/fusion_title][fusion_text columns="""" column_min_width="""" column_spacing="""" rule_style=""default"" rule_size="""" rule_color="""" content_alignment_medium="""" content_alignment_small="""" content_alignment="""" hide_on_mobile=""small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility"" sticky_display=""normal,sticky"" class="""" id="""" font_size="""" fusion_font_family_text_font="""" fusion_font_variant_text_font="""" line_height="""" letter_spacing="""" text_color="""" animation_type="""" animation_direction=""left"" animation_speed=""0.3"" animation_offset=""""]

To connect and engage consumers, develop <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/audience-targeting/"">audience targeting</a> strategies rooted in the actual behaviors, demographics, and context of your existing <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/3-simple-steps-audience-first-data-strategy"">first-party audience</a>. Then create impactful segmentation strategies for your existing audience as well as with those audiences you want to target – to get net-new customers to engage with your brand.

When you do, results can be eye-opening. For instance, at Goodway, we recently worked with a client that has a large ecommerce presence selling a variety of at-home products across a couple primary categories. From a creative and audience standpoint, there’d been an assumption that cross-brand messaging can serve as a great upsell tactic to get customers from one brand to buy from another. We wanted to work with the data and actually test this assumption.

We checked if there was any amount of natural cross-over purchasing between the client’s brand categories in the first place. Surprisingly, we found little crossover between brands. The purchaser buckets from the client’s two brands were largely mutually exclusive to one another. Next, we examined the audience characteristics of both brands and spotted some key differences. In this case, the client’s data combined with ours informed us a cross-brand upsell strategy <em>wasn’t the right one</em>. Instead, the data revealed we should build more individual audience targeting strategies for each brand.

3) Keep Pulse on the Future of Data, Identity and Privacy

Data analytics as a practice has been historically siloed to an individual  team, but the mindset and skill set are now being infused across organizations. Justin thinks this evolution will really pick up steam in 2021, especially now that the C-suite is paying more attention to data analytics and looking to marketing to drive results.

“Now we finally <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/library/prove-your-advertising-works/"">have the ability to measure and track marketing</a> and put things in place to get a full view of the customer,” Justin says. “<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/5-ways-to-say-goodbye-to-cookies"">The cookie may be crumbling</a>, but a lot of new partnerships and avenues are forming that will help give clarity into those users with or without the cookie.” In fact, Goodway is one such company now taking part in a few councils where we get to dig in and partner with leading buyers and publishers in the digital advertising industry and think about ad tech challenges from a discovery, targeting and measurement standpoint.

Ben says he’s excited to see the ad tech industry actively getting their hands dirty to come up with alternative and sustainable identity and privacy solutions to test and implement. He thinks this will serve everyone in the ecosystem better. “Though a lot of challenges lie ahead when it comes to data, especially related to identity and privacy, <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/consumers-will-want-third-party-cookies-back/"">third-party cookies</a> going away in Chrome, and the IDFA consent on iOS, they force ad tech to come up with a better long-term solution.”

“<a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/resources/library/cookieless-101-guide/"">Targeting is not going to be like the targeting with third-party cookies</a> that we’ve been used to,” he said. “There will be obstacles, and there won’t be 100% match rate, but the unfolding solutions will be something that works for marketers and consumers in the end. 2021 is going to be a great step forward in getting there.”

Justin is also <a href=""https://goodwaygroup.com/blog/three-reasons-why-the-future-of-digital-marketing-is-bright/"">optimistic about digital marketing's future</a>. When he thinks of the challenges ahead, he sees only new opportunities such as these. “You can put the consumer first across your website or mobile app and really think through that data-driven marketing process and what that journey looks like starting from the consumer,” he said. “And companies and brands can put the consumer first through this journey while ensuring acknowledgements exist along the way to build brand equity through one-to-one relationships.”
